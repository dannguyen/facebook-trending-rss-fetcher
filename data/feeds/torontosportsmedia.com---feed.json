Busy time in the sports world with everyone hard at work covering the playoffs and getting ready for the summer sports. Accordingly there is a surfeit of newsworthy items\u00a0to cover and I am invariably going to leave plenty of things out. Please add whatever you saw or heard in the comments below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Suggested Soundtrack:</span> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv96yJYhk3M\" target=\"_blank\">Nirvana &#8211; You Know You&#8217;re Right</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Programming note</em>: I&#8217;m on assignment for the next few weeks so Jonah will be holding down the fort for a while. Follow me on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mikeinboston\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> for occasional sports media observations. Retweets are sometimes sincere.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sports Radio Polls</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fine folks over at <strong><a href=\"http://platinumseatghosts.blogspot.ca\" target=\"_blank\">Platinum Seat Ghosts</a>\u00a0</strong>ran\u00a0a series of twitter polls evaluating the current sports radio line-ups. Numeris\u00a0doesn&#8217;t publicly reveal the composition of their PPM pool nor its size but I have been told by people in the industry that the number of PPMs worn by males 25-54 in Toronto in 2015 was\u00a0287. That number covers all genres of radio: talk, traffic, music, etc. The actual\u00a0number of PPMs worn by sports radio listeners is unknown, but a reasonable guess would be that at least 50% of people listen exclusively to music. Among those that listen to talk radio, many probably listen to 1010/640/CBC rather than sports. So you&#8217;re probably down to 30-60 PPMs devoted to sports radio. A laughably small sample size.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By comparison 250 actual sports fans participated in the PSG poll. Obviously the data is going to be skewed in two ways: 1) it&#8217;s a Twitter poll and that means the older demo likely is underrepresented, 2) it&#8217;s a hockey blog so shows that are strong on other sports may\u00a0do less well. With that out of the way, let&#8217;s have a look at the results.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Which one do you prefer?</p>\n<p>&mdash; Platinum Seat Ghosts (@3rdPeriodSuits) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/3rdPeriodSuits/status/724608547829481475\">April 25, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Which one do you prefer?</p>\n<p>&mdash; Platinum Seat Ghosts (@3rdPeriodSuits) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/3rdPeriodSuits/status/724608814339624960\">April 25, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Which one do you prefer?</p>\n<p>&mdash; Platinum Seat Ghosts (@3rdPeriodSuits) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/3rdPeriodSuits/status/724609003167223814\">April 25, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Which one do you prefer?</p>\n<p>&mdash; Platinum Seat Ghosts (@3rdPeriodSuits) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/3rdPeriodSuits/status/724609138328629248\">April 25, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Which one do you prefer?</p>\n<p>&mdash; Platinum Seat Ghosts (@3rdPeriodSuits) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/3rdPeriodSuits/status/724609257371373568\">April 25, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The obvious thing that jumps out is how different these results are from the Numeris ratings, where TSN1050 is getting trounced along most dimensions. Recent numbers show the Fan590 with 2 to 3\u00a0times the overall market share of TSN1050, and\u00a0huge leads in each time slot. Here are a few take-aways from the above:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dean Blundell is very unpopular. I have no idea how much of his score\u00a0is based on the quality of the show versus his reputation as the guy who <a href=\"http://torontosportsmedia.com/sports-and-toronto/seen-heard-weekend-edition-21/19062\" target=\"_blank\">doesn&#8217;t see anything homophobic</a> about rape jokes involving gay men, or whose last show was sanctioned several times for being misogynistic. Regardless, as a morning show they have a large budget and should be able to get big guests as a way to compensate for Blundell&#8217;s baggage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Landsberg and Naylor have to feel good about beating Dean 8-2. I suspect things will be a little different when Numeris releases the spring book. But this is a good start for a show that has only been on the air for a little over 2 months.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The split between the two mid-morning show seems about right to me. Blair/Ennis/Madani/Brunt is good radio most days. Cauz + Wheeler is a good alternative option if Blair doesn&#8217;t float your boat. A little something for everyone there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Walker v Richards: I&#8217;m surprised this one isn&#8217;t closer to 50-50 given Mike&#8217;s more established brand as a solo host. Walker&#8217;s show is much more well-rounded though, and given that hockey is on the back burner\u00a0in this market until October, the results seem plausible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The afternoon drive\u00a0time results are surprising but clearly a reflection of Bob&#8217;s stature among younger hockey fans. I suspect if a Jays blog ran the same poll, PTS would have fared much better. Still, TSN has to feel good that its signature afternoon show is popular.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Polls are fun. Let&#8217;s try one:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<a name=\"pd_a_9403306\"></a>\r\n<div class=\"PDS_Poll\" id=\"PDI_container9403306\" data-settings=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;\\/\\/static.polldaddy.com\\/p\\/9403306.js&quot;}\" style=\"display:inline-block;\"></div>\r\n<div id=\"PD_superContainer\"></div>\r\n<noscript><a href=\"http://polldaddy.com/poll/9403306\">Take Our Poll</a></noscript><script type='text/javascript'>\n(function(d,c,j){if(!d.getElementById(j)){var pd=d.createElement(c),s;pd.id=j;pd.src='http://torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/plugins/polldaddy/js/polldaddy-shortcode.js';s=d.getElementsByTagName(c)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(pd,s);}  else if(typeof jQuery !=='undefined')jQuery(d.body).trigger('pd-script-load');}(document,'script','pd-polldaddy-loader'));\n</script>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jonah and I are planning to do a spring &#8220;report card&#8221; post around the time the new ratings book comes out. In preparation, we are both trying to listen to a lot of radio.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Help us do our homework:</span>\u00a0What are some things we should listen for? What drives you crazy on either station? How do you interpret the above results?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Colabello\u00a0Wrap Up</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The big story of last weekend was Jays&#8217; first baseman Chris Colabello testing positive for a banned substance and being suspended for 80 games. Many people wrote about it in the papers. Here is <strong>Steve Buffery</strong> with a <a href=\"http://www.torontosun.com/2016/04/23/blue-jays-chris-colabello-needs-to-prove-his-innocence\" target=\"_blank\">good analysis</a>\u00a0of why his denials ring hollow, and a good follow up <a href=\"http://www.torontosun.com/2016/04/26/i-cried-and-cried-jays-chris-colabello-talks-about-positive-drug-test\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> after Colabello spoke publicly\u00a0(more on that in a second).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Jays are owned by Rogers. Sportsnet is owned by Rogers. Sportsnet employs lots\u00a0of reporters,\u00a0journalists, and broadcasters to cover the Jays. The obvious question was: how they would treat the issue. Would they attack the story with the same tenacity as they would if they\u00a0weren&#8217;t owned by a common employer?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The results were\u00a0a little mixed but basically positive. There was clearly no &#8220;soft journalism&#8221; mandate. Many at Sportsnet were highly critical of the player, as well as his public statements. This <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/big-read-blue-jays-chris-colabello-still-seeking-answers/\" target=\"_blank\">piece</a> by <strong>Arden Zwelling</strong>, for example,<strong>\u00a0</strong>is excellent. The one suspect decision was the following:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Exclusive: Chris Colabello sits down with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SNETCampbell\">@SNETCampbell</a> tonight on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlueJays?src=hash\">#BlueJays</a> Central <a href=\"https://t.co/iaUNQHx7wX\">https://t.co/iaUNQHx7wX</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5NijkQmTrP\">pic.twitter.com/5NijkQmTrP</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sportsnet/status/724995606498926592\">April 26, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Join <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SNETCampbell\">@SNETCampbell</a> tonight on 6:30 ET SN ONE for an exclusive sit-down interview with Chris Colabello to discuss the 80-game MLB suspension.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Gregg Zaun (@GreggZaun) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreggZaun/status/725018475920527360\">April 26, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SNETCampbell\">@SNETCampbell</a> exclusive conversation with Chris Colabello airs tonight on Blue Jays Central.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bluejays?src=hash\">#bluejays</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/colabello?src=hash\">#colabello</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/8UR16R0ztT\">https://t.co/8UR16R0ztT</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; George Skoutakis (@GeorgeSkoutakis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeSkoutakis/status/725039759450607616\">April 26, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>First, can we put the bar a little higher on using\u00a0the word &#8220;exclusive&#8221;? Giving yourself a reacharound for having a fellow employee appear on your station is not a journalistic\u00a0accomplishment. It trivializes the hard\u00a0work that leads to real exclusive stories. Good for the people at Sportsnet who refrained from tweeting about their big &#8220;exclusive&#8221;. I noticed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ok, with that out of the way I want to discuss the merits of using the perpetually youthful\u00a0<strong>Jamie Campbell</strong>. Jamie did a great job and asked all the tough questions. That&#8217;s not my issue. Rather, the question\u00a0is why give this assignment to Jamie rather than someone else? As mentioned above, Zwelling has done exemplary work as a journalist over the last few years. So has <strong>Shi Davidi</strong>. Oh, and by the way, you also have <strong>Stephen Brunt</strong> on the roster.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They went with\u00a0someone who is part of the Jays broadcast team instead\u00a0of\u00a0someone with a little more independence from the team. By using Campbell the network opens itself up to the criticism that the team is calling the shots. Why open that door if you have other options? As I have mentioned before, Brunt seems to be tragically mis-used at Sportsnet. This would have been perfect for him. He&#8217;s a long time critic of baseball&#8217;s arbitrary\u00a0(his words, not mine) stance on PEDs. He&#8217;s also the most journalistically credible person at the network.\u00a0Would Colabello have appeared with Brunt? Maybe Colabello would only do it with Jamie. Who knows.\u00a0But the audience was not as well served by Sportsnet as it could have been in this instance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The best thing to come out of this was Campbell&#8217;s appearance with Brunt and <strong>Jeff Blair</strong> on the Jeff Blair Show (<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/JeffBlairShow\" target=\"_blank\">April 27, Hour 2</a>), now featuring Jeff Blair and his\u00a0sensitive new voice. It was a great discussion by all three. Jamie reported several anecdotes about seeing Colabello inspect ingredient labels while in the food court, and turning down smoothies even though they looked delicious. The other two rightly jumped all over this talking point. Cheaters all look clean until they get caught, and then the plethora of drug tests they\u00a0passed with flying colours don&#8217;t mean anything. All you are left with at that stage are technicalities and\u00a0half-truths about never &#8220;knowingly&#8221; taking anything banned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is possible that Colabello took a tainted approved supplement or that someone slipped something into his protein shake. It&#8217;s just not very likely.\u00a0I&#8217;m not sure I care very much. This is baseball. Cheating is part of the game&#8217;s legacy. Marcus Stroman was suspended for a PED violation. Does anyone refuse to root for him on account of that? Colabello will likely re-emerge and take some more swings for the Jays this season. If the team does well and he contributes, no one will hold this against him. If he flunks out of the league it will be because he can&#8217;t hit anymore, and then people will chalk up his brief success to the PEDs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Over to you:</span> how did Sportsnet handle the Colabello story?\u00a0</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Quick Hits</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While people are excited about the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-toronto-more-dirt-makes-for-a-cleaner-game-1460653304\" target=\"_blank\">new dirt infield</a> at the Dome, the grass discussions have died down significantly.

Doesn&#8217;t sound promising, and Shapiro has never said anything unequivocally positive about the idea.

I am working on a story on unpaid internships in sports media. If you have insights, drop me a line.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The #MoreThanMean video is <del>almost</del> too hard to watch. I cannot imagine what it is like to be on the receiving end of that kind of harassment. If you or someone you know has ever threatened someone with rape on Twitter, please seek out help.

With no offence intended to <strong>Jackie Redmond</strong>, who discussed the video with Dean Blundell, Hazel is\u00a0a veteran of the industry, goes back to the days before Twitter, and has a wide range of experience in multiple cities. (Sorry if I missed someone interviewing her). Lastly, in light of this video, I am <em>slightly</em> more sympathetic\u00a0to <strong>Matt Cauz</strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"http://torontosportsmedia.com/sports-and-toronto/seen-heard-weekend-edition-51/19863\" target=\"_blank\">radical proposal</a> that people on twitter should be microchipped so they can be zapped remotely when they tweet stupid things.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Steve Simmons</strong> appeared on <a href=\"http://www.torontomike.com/2016/04/toronto_miked_podcast_episode_170.html\" target=\"_blank\">Toronto Mike</a>&#8216;s podcast this week.

Accordingly we will be trading our bath robes for cowls and capes and will spend\u00a0most of our time here talking about the nuances of what is and is not acceptable in the wide world of sports.\u00a0If this sort of stuff really annoys you, consider this your trigger warning.

He was then seen shouting <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/andrew-shaw-on-apparent-video-of-him-shouting-gay-slur-1771967379\" target=\"_blank\">what looked like</a> &#8220;fuck you, fucking faggot&#8221; at one of the officials. This was broadcast to the hundreds of thousands of people watching in bars and at home.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This happened on a Tuesday night and was the dominant story on Wednesday in most places. What would the NHL do? Should the NHL do anything?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here is a round-up of the good, bad, and ugly of how the media covered this story prior\u00a0to\u00a0the NHL&#8217;s eventual 1 (playoff) game suspension.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Good:</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stephen Brunt</strong> appeared on <strong>Andrew Walker</strong>&#8216;s radio show (<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheMorningShow\" target=\"_blank\">April 20, Hour 1</a>) and the two had a good discussion, culminating in Brunt&#8217;s wise point that\u00a0regardless of whether this had been part of the culture in the past, the goal is to eradicate it from the culture going forward. That can only happen by setting good precedents in the present.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jeff Marek</strong> did a very professional job drawing out <strong>Nick Kypreos</strong> as the latter was advocating for the following predictable stance: &#8220;How can you be sure what he said! You need proof! You can&#8217;t convict him based on lip-reading!&#8221; Nick had all the fervour and confidence of someone who has watched a lot of Law &amp; Order. Jeff calmly explained to him that legal standards are appropriate to courts of law and that sports leagues are different. Kypreos pushed back endlessly but eventually ran out of gas when Marek simply asked &#8220;what do you think he said Nick?&#8221; <strong>Doug MacLean</strong> also added valuable insights on how the Hawks&#8217; coach and the GM would approach defending the player. (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/hockey-central-noon-april/id354153569?i=367204737&amp;mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">April 20</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Species1967</strong> over at PPP had\u00a0a very clear and compelling <a href=\"http://www.pensionplanpuppets.com/2016/4/20/11466532/andrew-shaw-blackhawks-whats-said-on-the-ice-doesnt-stay-on-the-ice\" target=\"_blank\">analysis</a> of why the NHL has to leave precedent behind and set new standards for its players going forward. In particular he nicely points out the conflict between those who argue that what is said on the ice should stay on the ice and the fact that &#8220;the league&#8217;s national broadcaster in Canada touts its 4KHD TV ensures you won&#8217;t miss even the smallest detail of action in a game.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chris Hine</strong>\u00a0of the Chicago Tribune talks about the Shaw case from his <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-shaw-homophobic-slur-blackhawks-spt-0421-20160420-column.html\" target=\"_blank\">perspective</a> as an openly gay sports reporter. &#8220;Now put yourself in the shoes of a closeted gay athlete. You&#8217;re in a locker room or on a playing field, and you hear your teammates use that word. You start thinking, &#8220;Is this how they really feel about gay people? Is that what they would call me if I came out to them? Would I still be a member of this team? Would my career be over?&#8221;&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Damien Cox</strong> continued his strong critical stance of the NHL in matters relating to the league&#8217;s handling of on-ice violence. In this <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/nhl-must-take-strong-stance-homophobic-slurs/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> (<em>auto-play ads &amp; video warning</em>) he lays out the comparison with the NBA case involving Rajon Rondo as well as the 2011 NHL case involving Sean Avery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Aside</strong></em>: comments are disabled on Cox&#8217;s piece on Sportsnet. There is no link given to the editorial policy that explains why this is the case. By contrast, the Brunt piece we discussed last week is up to 450+ comments. Here are the top two by &#8220;likes&#8221;:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><b>Dan Fitzgerald</b> <span class=\"s2\">Rank 10111 &#8212;\u00a0</span>&#8220;This is not his team yet. Whether they win this year or not he will dismantle the Jays. Bye Edwin, Bye Jose etc etc etc. The seats won&#8217;t be filled next year.\u00a0Mr. Rogers shame on you.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><b>topherben</b> <span class=\"s1\">Rank 1737 &#8212; &#8220;</span>Well, I guess since Rogers so badly bungled bringing Shapiro over here in the first place, the least they can do is leverage their media assets to rehabilitate his image post-haste. I mean how many of these &#8220;Mark Shapiro really isn&#8217;t such a bad guy&#8221; articles is Sportsnet planning to have written this season&#8230;..&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sportsnet also allows you to sort comments by &#8220;Editor&#8217;s Pick&#8221; which was my next step. Here is what shows up:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Brunt-comments.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-20743\"><img class=\" wp-image-20743 aligncenter\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Brunt-comments.jpg?resize=490%2C257\" alt=\"Brunt comments\" srcset=\"http://i1.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Brunt-comments.jpg?resize=768%2C404 768w, http://i1.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Brunt-comments.jpg?resize=950%2C499 950w, http://i1.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Brunt-comments.jpg?w=959 959w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t be bothered to highlight any of the 450 comments, then maybe ditch the Editor&#8217;s Pick model? More generally though, it would be nice to have a consistent policy on comments. Not allowing comments on sensitive topics is understandable in some cases to protect the writer from abuse, or because of limited resources to moderate the discussion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But this is Cox and this is Sportsnet. He can take the heat, and you can afford to hire full-time moderators to keep the trolls and hate-speech out. TSN ditched comments back in January, shifting everything to their social media platforms, because, as everyone knows, when you want to discuss how the Leafs off-season is going you want to do it on TSN&#8217;s Instagram page.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More on this topic in the weeks to come &#8230; back to the topic at hand.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Bad:</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bryan Hayes</strong> asked a very good question: would the NHL be forced to act simply because the entire incident was caught on video? Absent the video would they still be inclined to do more than give him a slap on the wrist? If this is such a good question, why is Bryan being lumped\u00a0in the Bad section? Read on &#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As has become the norm on Overdrive, rather than letting Dog carry the conversation, the Noodle leapt right in and it sounded something like this: &#8220;wordswordswordswords, seat belts, smoking, racism!, Tiger Woods, wordswordswords &#8230;&#8221; By the time he was done Dog had gone back to texting and so it was Bryan and <strong>Jamie McLennan</strong>\u00a0debating a topic about which the latter had so many thoughts it was as if he had none at all. Not exactly good radio.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether you like it or not, <strong>Bob McCown</strong> has set the expectation for the timeslot. The timeslot demands competent intellectual analysis of the big stories of the week. The current roster was\u00a0not capable of doing that in this instance. This is a problem that is not going to go away on its own, and Summer Is Coming &#8230;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Ugly:</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On to <strong>Leafs Lunch</strong>. As I was was making the podcast rounds on Friday morning (April 22) I asked myself:\u00a0what were <strong>Andi Petrillo</strong>&#8216;s\u00a0thoughts on the Shaw suspension? Here&#8217;s what TSN&#8217;s iTunes podcast feed\u00a0looked like on Friday morning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/leafslunch.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-20748\"><img class=\" wp-image-20748 aligncenter\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/leafslunch.jpg?resize=620%2C684\" alt=\"leafslunch\" srcset=\"http://i0.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/leafslunch.jpg?resize=272%2C300 272w, http://i0.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/leafslunch.jpg?w=740 740w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In other words, two full days had gone by and no one had bothered to update the feed. Glancing down it seems like the is a problem most weeks. The message from TSN is pretty clear: <em><strong>we don&#8217;t care about our radio station, and neither should you!</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the NHL got this one right and they deserve credit for that. What Shaw did was not the worst thing anyone has ever done.\u00a0Is this still something worth stamping out? Of course.\u00a0Clearly if we had\u00a0to choose between stopping jocks from calling each other faggots or stopping gays from being assaulted or fired for their sexual preferences we should work on the latter. Thankfully we don&#8217;t have to choose. We can work on both problems at the same time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Over to you:</span>\u00a01)\u00a0Did the media blow this incident out of proportion? 2) Who is missing from the above Good/Bad/Ugly/Silent list?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Company We Keep</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Asw6waV.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-20742\"><img class=\" wp-image-20742 aligncenter\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Asw6waV.jpg?resize=483%2C268\" alt=\"Asw6waV\" srcset=\"http://i2.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Asw6waV.jpg?resize=300%2C167 300w, http://i2.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Asw6waV.jpg?w=560 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ESPN fired <strong>Curt Schilling</strong> this week. Schilling had posted a message on social media warning people that allowing transgender individuals to use the bathroom\u00a0that matches their gender identity would put their daughters at risk from men pretending to be women. This is a reaction\u00a0to a widely repudiated law from North Carolina. The NBA is being <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15211380/adam-silver-says-north-carolina-law-problematic-nba-no-all-star-game-decision\" target=\"_blank\">pressured</a> to move its All Star game in response.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As any sensible person can see, allowing individuals to use the bathroom of their choice won&#8217;t affect the fact that assault is already very illegal. So this is only worth bringing up if you want to profess your dislike for trans folk under the guise of concern for the children.\u00a0If you&#8217;re interested in what goes on inside the mind of a self-righteous bigot, Outsports has <a href=\"http://www.outsports.com/2016/4/19/11464530/curt-schilling-trans-espn-facebook-post\" target=\"_blank\">screencaps</a> of Schilling&#8217;s\u00a0deleted posts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Richard Deitsch</strong> over at SI.com has a <a href=\"http://www.si.com/more-sports/2016/04/20/media-circus-curt-schilling-fired-espn-transgender-comments\" target=\"_blank\">run down</a> on how we arrived at this point and Schilling&#8217;s long and illustrious track record of hateful and uninformed comments. &#8220;This isn\u2019t a freedom of speech issue because Schilling\u2019s speech isn\u2019t being censored on his feed. He has every right to espouse whatever he wants, and his employer in turn, has every right to respond accordingly should it have issues with those opinions, which ESPN clearly did. In reality had Schilling been an analyst that ESPN felt it could not live without, he likely would have gotten a longer rope, perhaps been given a lengthy suspension here as opposed to an outright termination. But he\u2019s easily replaceable \u2013 as most of us are. I\u2019d expect him to work somewhere in the sports media again, but it will not be at ESPN.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t imagine too many other sports outlets will be calling. Schilling wore out his welcome in the state of Rhode Island when we he bilked the taxpayers for millions. He&#8217;s still a celebrity among Tea Party enthusiasts in\u00a0Massachusetts, but media is about eyes and ears and clicks, and that demo is both a minority in MA and well outside the target demo for advertisers. It will be interesting to see where he lands. I suspect he will spend a year or two on the Make America Great Again\u00a0speaking circuit before coming back to sports. \u00a0(A<em>side</em>: Deitsch&#8217;s SI articles grind my system to a halt on both my laptop and my tablet. Anyone else?)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Completing the social justice hat-trick, <strong>Bomani Jones</strong> went on an ESPN show <a href=\"http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/bomani-jones-wore-caucasians-shirt-mike-mike-parodying-cleveland-indians.html\" target=\"_blank\">wearing the well-know</a> &#8220;Caucasians&#8221; shirt that parodies the racist Cleveland Indians &#8220;Chief Wahoo&#8221; logo. He was told to cover it up by someone at ESPN though the details around that are sketchy. The Indians decided to <a href=\"http://www.thescore.com/news/997351\" target=\"_blank\">demote</a> the logo from its main perch to one of less prominence recently. This comes at a time when British teams are getting rid of their <a href=\"https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/native-american-names-british-sport-borrowed-tradition-or-imported-racism\" target=\"_blank\">racist team names</a>. In Canada, the main offender is the Edmonton CFL team The Eskimos. There is a good debate to be had about when a team name/logo is racist versus merely being culturally appropriative.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Over to you:</span> 1) Do you agree with Deitsch that Schilling had become replaceable and was canned rather than suspended as a result? 2) If the Eskimos came out tomorrow and said they were\u00a0changing the name to something more representative of the city, would you care?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Quick Hits</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This was the off-season of the Bat Flip in MLB, and almost everyone weighed in on the topic. The new commissioner seems to be <a href=\"http://www.thescore.com/news/996614\" target=\"_blank\">on the side</a> of those who think baseball&#8217;s young stars should shape the game in their own image. Good.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the subject of homophobic comments, <strong>Dean Blundell</strong> is in the news again. The comments made on his show by his\u00a0former producer are being used as the basis for an <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/appeal-to-be-heard-involving-shock-jock-dean-blundells-producers-on-air-comments/article29699213/\" target=\"_blank\">appeal</a>. Rogers can&#8217;t be thrilled that his name is being associated with their company or that the Globe keeps using this picture every time they write about the comments that got him fired. If you need a refresher on why Dean still doesn&#8217;t think his comments were homophobic, go <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/the-second-coming-of-dean-blundell/article18723532/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>\u00a0to this column by <strong>Simon Houpt</strong> of the Globe (which for some reason is not linked within\u00a0the other Globe article).

If this is your first time reading Seen &amp; Heard, we use this space to reflect back on the week that was in sports media.\u00a0Traffic has spiked in the last while and the comments sections have been on topic and highly engaging. Several people in the media have mentioned to me how good the discussion has been here lately. Let&#8217;s keep that ball rolling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Suggested Soundtrack:</span> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mssm8Ml5sOo\" target=\"_blank\">Wye Oak &#8211; Civilian</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As always, if you spot a mistake or think something I have written is unfair, email or DM. You can DM me even if we are not following each other. Ok, let&#8217;s go &#8230;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>JaysTalk</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Blue Jays front office made news twice\u00a0this week. First, on Tuesday\u00a0we learned that popular executive Stephen R Brooks was <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/sports/bluejays/2016/04/12/blue-jays-vp-stephen-brooks-resigns.html\" target=\"_blank\">leaving</a> to pursue other employment &#8220;opportunities&#8221;, namely the ones that are available to the unexpectedly unemployed. The second item of news was that Sportsnet would be featuring a documentary on new Jays President Mark Shapiro prior to Sunday&#8217;s game. Let&#8217;s deal with these in turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Brooks departure\u00a0sent waves through the industry on several levels. Brooks was arguably the most recognizable face (see face below) in the front office\u00a0last year, after AA and Beeston.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ana3uU_E_400x400.jpeg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-20704\"><img class=\"wp-image-20705 aligncenter\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ana3uU_E_400x400.jpeg?resize=319%2C319\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"http://i1.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ana3uU_E_400x400.jpeg?resize=150%2C150 150w, http://i1.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ana3uU_E_400x400.jpeg?resize=300%2C300 300w, http://i1.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ana3uU_E_400x400.jpeg?resize=50%2C50 50w, http://i1.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ana3uU_E_400x400.jpeg?resize=178%2C178 178w, http://i1.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ana3uU_E_400x400.jpeg?resize=60%2C60 60w, http://i1.wp.com/torontosportsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ana3uU_E_400x400.jpeg?w=400 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>His notoriety was largely due to his Twitter presence, and his stalwart\u00a0efforts to quickly and accurately answer fan questions about everything from gate entrances, to ticket refunds, to what happened to the &#8220;all you can eat&#8221; section. In brief, Brooks was the first point of contact for many Jays fans who had\u00a0questions and concerns. He was very very good at his job.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here is his goodbye tweet:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I want to thank everyone for their best wishes. I am truly humbled. You are the best fans in the game. I am so very grateful. My best,SB.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Stephen R Brooks (@sbrooksbaseball) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sbrooksbaseball/status/720285902203789315\">April 13, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond the impact on fans, several writers opined on what this departure means for the identity of the front office. <a href=\"http://www.torontosun.com/2016/04/12/blue-jays-lose-another-canadian-from-front-office\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a> is The Sun/Postmedia&#8217;s <strong>Bob Elliott</strong>:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Rogers Communications web site boasts that Rogers is \u201ca diversified public Canadian communications and media company\u201d &#8230; that actually \u201cemploys some Canadians at the top.\u201d\u00a0Canada\u2019s Team? How about changing the slogan to: \u201cCanada\u2019s Team &#8230; Canadians need not apply for vacancies with high salaries.\u201d&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sportsnet&#8217;s <strong>Shi Davidi</strong> raised similar worries about &#8220;Americanization&#8221; in his <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/americanization-blue-jays-growing-concern-canadians/\" target=\"_blank\">piece</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;[The] Blue Jays have given Canadians an opportunity to enter the business side of the game, something that visa restrictions makes difficult for them to do in the United States. Assistant general manager Andrew Tinnish is now the highest ranking Canadian on the baseball operations side of the club, working his way up from a baseball operations intern in 2001.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Others personalities at Sportsnet chimed in on the issue with their trademark depth and insight:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Shapiro fyred the Jays guy on Twitter and hyred somebuddy from cleevland!!!? Blarrrgggh!!!!!!</p>\n<p>&mdash; Andrew Walker (@FAN590Walker) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FAN590Walker/status/720025105800114176\">April 12, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The story might have ended here , however Shapiro stoked the coals into a fire with this incendiary\u00a0quote on how to replace\u00a0Brooks&#8217; presence on Twitter:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We\u2019ll certainly have to address <em><strong>the Twitter</strong></em>, that\u2019s the primary spokesmen\u2019s role there. We\u2019ll have to address that and look to back-fill that with someone else in the organization. Throughout baseball and sport, the primary spokesmen in the organization are hopefully the manager, the players and then the general manager. <em><strong>You default to club president and business leaders</strong> <strong>only in very small situations and circumstances</strong></em>.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is a puzzling statement\u00a0to say the least. Setting aside the verbal flub (George W Bush didn&#8217;t really think there was more than one internet, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKTH6f1JfX8\">right</a>?), he says several interesting things here. First, he <em>seems</em> to dismiss the value of Brooks&#8217; work by suggesting they can find someone else on the existing roster to step in. In other words, Brooks&#8217; Twitter work was fairly minor. Second, he leaves open the following implication: <strong>Brooks was often speaking out of turn. </strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what he could possibly have in mind. All I ever saw from Brooks&#8217; feed was useful, if somewhat curt, answers to reasonable\u00a0questions.\u00a0It&#8217;s possible that Shapiro resented how Brooks positioned himself vis-a-vis the dirt infield renovations. The latter\u00a0tweeted out regular photo updates and was very clearly invested in the project, its timeline, and the nuts and bolts of the science behind getting the right consistency. Perhaps this was far outside his mandated job portfolio? Who knows. Regardless, the claim that business leaders should be seen but not heard sticks out and calls for clarification. Hopefully the local media will follow up on this and the truth will eventually come out.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Last thought on this story: both Elliott and Davidi tried to kindle our collective national pride in their reporting. I don&#8217;t really see this as a viable angle. Yes, it is hard for Canadians to work in the U.S. so they will likely face hurdles when competing against Americans for jobs down south. It is also true that Beeston, AA, and Brooks are all Canadian. However none of that seems relevant to the current state of affairs. Was Shapiro looking for an excuse to can Brooks because he hates Canadians? Ridiculous idea. This isn&#8217;t <em>that</em> JaysTalk. Would Brooks have kept his job despite his supposed\u00a0gaffes if he were American? Equally preposterous.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t accuse Elliott or Davidi of jingoism, but the media need to raise the bar on what counts as a justification for sounding the patriotism alarm. There are a lot of things about which to be upset at\u00a0the Jays front office and their parent company. That Americans are currently sitting in chairs previously held by Canadians is not one of them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sunday edit</span>: <strong>Steve Simmons</strong> has a <a href=\"http://www.torontosun.com/2016/04/16/simmons-says-jays-shapiro-needs-to-figure-out-toronto-market\" target=\"_blank\">great take</a> on the Brooks firing, and Shapiro&#8217;s media problem.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Over to you:</span></strong> <strong>1) Is there more than\u00a0meets the eye here with the Brooks departure?, 2) Do you care that Shapiro, Atkins, and Brooks&#8217; replacement are not Canadian?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>I&#8217;m Just a Soul Whose Intentions are Good</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moving along, the second major story is Stephen Brunt&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/blue-jays-shapiro-new-toronto-faced-critics/\" target=\"_blank\">thoughts\u00a0on the misunderstood Mark Shapiro</a>. This article is both a freestanding piece but also a tease for what Sportsnet is promoting as\u00a0a documentary that will air at 12:30 on Sportsnet on Sunday, before the Jays take on the Red Sox.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>[Aside: removed. Question answered]</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The main thesis of Brunt&#8217;s article, as far as I can tell, is that the antipathy towards Shapiro is due to circumstances beyond his control. The point of the piece is to lay the case\u00a0out, presumably with the goal of getting people to evaluate the man based on his own actions. Here&#8217;s one of Brunt&#8217;s opening paragraphs:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Here was a fairy tale playing out right before their eyes, a club transformed at the trade deadline through the wizardry of Alex Anthopoulos\u2014Canadian, former Expos fanboy, in every way one of their own\u2014now rolling toward its first playoff appearance since 1993. And here was the new guy, brought in to replace Paul Beeston, but for all intents and purposes the person who would now shape the Blue Jays in his own image on and off the field, hailing from Cleveland of all places\u2014the name of the town uttered as though the Indians, not the Blue Jays, had been a baseball punchline for the previous 22 seasons.\u00a0Shapiro was instantly cast as Skeletor, as Darth Vader. Cue the heel\u2019s walk-out music.\u00a0And why did he pronounce his name that way?&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most of that is fairly accurate. Shapiro was hired right around the time the Jays&#8217; 2015\u00a0season flipped the switch from disappointing to exhilarating. Anthopoulos is indeed Canadian, as is Beeston. What is not accurate is that Shapiro was <em><strong>instantly</strong></em> cast as a villain. That came both much earlier and much later.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Recall that Shapiro was hired to replace Day 1 employee Paul Beeston. The search began back in November of 2014 when, as we all know by now, Ed Rogers started making calls to executives employed around the league. This <a href=\"http://www.torontosun.com/2015/01/23/the-inside-story-on-how-rogers-tried-to-replace-blue-jays-president-paul-beeston\" target=\"_blank\">excellent piece</a> by Bob Elliott chronicles the\u00a0embarrassing blow by blow of how that all went down. That horrible chapter of organizational incompetence finally ended with Shapiro&#8217;s hiring. So, it is true that Shapiro came in saddled with baggage entirely unrelated to his own actions. Brunt is 100% right about that. But the story is incomplete without discussing Ed Rogers&#8217; role in creating the stacked deck with which\u00a0Shapiro would be playing. It&#8217;s not just about Alex and Paul. In fact, I would argue, it&#8217;s mostly about Ed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Next, recall that the plan &#8211; at least as far as the fanbase was concerned &#8211; was for Shapiro to work with Alex in much the same structural arrangement as existed when Beeston was president. There would be changes to be sure, but Alex&#8217;s role would not be fundamentally different. Why would you mess with something that was, for the first time in two decades, yielding playoff results?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As we all know that narrative quickly crumbled. We heard\u00a0of purported <a href=\"http://www.tsn.ca/jays-offered-anthopoulos-3-year-extension-this-week-source-1.384678\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;scolding</a>&#8221; of AA for trading away so many prospects. We heard\u00a0that rather than looking to lock up Alex for years to come, Shapiro&#8217;s initial offer was a 1 year extension, or as one person put it to me, a &#8220;fuck off&#8221; offer. All of that happened <em><strong>after</strong></em>\u00a0Shapiro arrived. More recently we learned from <strong>Steve Simmons</strong> that Shapiro didn&#8217;t bother making an offer to David Price, even though Alex had left a plan for how to do it <a href=\"http://www.torontosun.com/2016/04/09/simmons-says-blue-jays-had-plan-to-keep-price\" target=\"_blank\">within budget parameters</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All of that to say that the story is more complicated than Brunt paints it. He is right that some of it is not Shapiro&#8217;s fault. The baseball moves that Shapiro has made have been sound, and he is perhaps not being given the credit he deserves. Further, we don&#8217;t know what pressures he is facing from ownership regarding payroll reductions in the years to come. Lastly, deep down many people know that you are not going to be able to sign EE or Jose to sensible deals and that it may be best to let them walk and take the picks at season&#8217;s end. Shapiro will be the evil public face for something few\u00a0of us want to admit is the right decision.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next section of Brunt&#8217;s article features a\u00a0confusing quote from Shapiro:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I could have been any more thoughtful [&#8230;] I\u2019m not sure I could have been any more culturally sensitive and aware. I\u2019m not sure I could have embraced the place I was coming to any more. <em><strong>There were certainly maybe some things I did that didn\u2019t help to endear me to people</strong></em>. But people were looking for things to not like about me rather than things to like about me. I view those as circumstances. It\u2019s the situation I walked into. Really, if you look at what happened, nothing was my choice. Nothing was about decisions I made. I was walking into a situation that dramatically changed from when I made the decision to come here to the time I started working here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Again, most of this is right. The situation really did change from when Shapiro signed on. The Jays went from 50-51 to the best team in baseball the rest of the way. The plan, one assumes, was to ride out another expensive disappointing season and then send Alex and many of his pricey acquisitions packing. Shapiro was ready to do the heavy lifting of tearing it down, retooling, and then building a contender. Or, exactly what Alex did 7\u00a0years ago when he took over from Riccardi.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The confusing part here is how Shapiro says he couldn&#8217;t have done more than he did in one breath and then says\u00a0that he &#8220;certainly maybe&#8221; also did things that made people not like him. Leaving aside the certainly-maybe oxymoron, I think he means that he was as gentle with the fanbase as he could be, but that he also had to make some moves that were going to be unpopular no matter what. Reading through the gaps, I think he&#8217;s talking about AA. When he was approached he agreed to take the presidency but only if he could install his own guy in Alex&#8217;s place, and only if he could be more active in baseball-related decisions. Rogers gave him that, and then the Jays promptly rocketed into the playoffs. That is not Shapiro&#8217;s fault. It&#8217;s the fault of the people negotiating with him on behalf of the Jays. They should have left themselves some wiggle room.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The rest of the article covers the interesting details of Shapiro&#8217;s life and upbringing. Brunt brings his peerless\u00a0writing skills to the subject and really gives us a feel for Shapiro as a human being. Go read it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A few questions to ponder:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why now?</strong> The season is under way and fans have largely forgotten about Alex and Beeston and are rightly focused on the the 2016 Blue Jays. I don&#8217;t really get the timing of this article and the accompanying video.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why Brunt?</strong> There is certainly news value here, but this seems much more up the alleys of Davidi, Zwelling, or any of a number of other Sportsnet affiliated writers. I know Brunt does whatever he wants these days, but I can&#8217;t help but think his talents are being wasted on this assignment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why at all?</strong>\u00a0Go have a glance at the 350+ comments attached to the article. Many of them completely shred Sportsnet for being a PR wing for Rogers. This one made me laugh out loud:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"vf-username\">Courtney01 [</span>Rank <span class=\"vf-rank-count\">1447] &#8220;</span>wow. now Shapiro is getting his own tv special? any word on the 6 part mini series?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I just don&#8217;t know why you would put your best and most trusted writer on a story that is not all that topical or timely, especially when the appearance will be that the team is using its media department to do damage control.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>Over to you:</strong></em></span><em><strong> 1)\u00a0Did the omission of the Ed Rogers aspect hurt Brunt&#8217;s piece? 2) Please comment here after it airs tomorrow. I will be on assignment and can&#8217;t watch.</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Postscript on the Concussion Coverage</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The reaction to last week&#8217;s\u00a0column on the <a href=\"http://torontosportsmedia.com/sports-and-toronto/seen-heard-weekend-edition-79/20661\">lack of coverage of the NHL concussion emails by Rogers</a> was strong and swift. Many people reached out privately to offer support, but some also reached out to tell me I was way off. The one place where there was significant disagreement was whether Gary would need to call Rogers to discuss how they would report on the emails. Many argued that a call would not be needed and that the &#8220;turn a blind eye&#8221; editorial policy was set in house. Others argued that the Sportsnet\u00a0writers were just very busy, and got around to covering it the following week.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting that if there was a soft journalism directive then it would appear that it was partially lifted last week. Michael Grange delivered a <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/dr-charles-tator-believes-concussions-will-change-hockey-culture/\" target=\"_blank\">terrific piece</a> on the medical science of concussions and how the game needs to change, featuring an in-depth interview with Dr. Tator. You know Dr. Tator &#8212; he&#8217;s the guy who <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/2009/12/20/don_cherry_blasts_doctor_for_totally_unfair_attack.html\" target=\"_blank\">feuded</a> with Don Cherry back in 2009. Grange&#8217;s article features the following quote from NHL exec Bill Daly:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Other than I don\u2019t agree with Dr. Tator\u2019s opinion, and that the actual facts belie it, I have no intention to comment further.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is a terrible way for the NHL to be framing their position. Daly is not a doctor and he shouldn&#8217;t be arguing the medical facts. The\u00a0NHL is making this mistake often in their legal strategy against the plaintiffs in the <a href=\"https://t.co/ns8FLllHRH\" target=\"_blank\">concussion lawsuit</a>. Let the doctors do their thing, and let other medical professionals debate the merits of the\u00a0evidence. The NHL comes off as &#8220;anti-science&#8221; in the same way that climate change deniers do.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The real legal question is what duties of care the league should be made to take on behalf of its employees, and what responsibility lies with the individual players. That is a productive and healthy discussion about which there is\u00a0a range of reasonable\u00a0positions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lastly, Len Boogaard, father of Derek, has been in the news\u00a0again. The people in charge of running the substance abuse program failed his son, though there is no shortage of other names on that long list. TSN&#8217;s\u00a0<strong>Rick Westhead</strong> explains the <a href=\"http://www.tsn.ca/co-founder-of-nhl-nhlpa-substance-abuse-program-under-investigation-1.467262\" target=\"_blank\">substance abuse program</a> that exists in the NHL. It seems like a system that is more designed to limit liability to the NHL and the PA than it is to help players suffering from addiction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mr. Boogaard appeared on PTS back in 2014 and gave perhaps the most poignant and memorable interview I have ever heard. The interview has been lost in the digital sands of time, and requests for a link from Sportsnet were ignored. You can read a little about it <a href=\"http://torontosportsmedia.com/sports-and-toronto/seen-heard-weekend-edition-35/19463\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. <strong>Bob McCown</strong> and <strong>Stephen Brunt</strong> were at their absolute best.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Quick Hits</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Wayne Gretzky</strong> had some <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/sports/hockey/wayne-gretzky-laments-decline-of-scoring-and-creativity-in-nhl.html\" target=\"_blank\">strong words</a> about the lack of scoring in the NHL and the general poor entertainment value of the game. The league needs more people like Gretzky involved in the future of the product.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Stoeten</strong> asks some <a href=\"http://bluejaysnation.com/2016/4/12/will-rogers-hockey-ratings-woes-impact-the-blue-jays\" target=\"_blank\">good questions</a> about the financial effect of the bad Rogers NHL ratings on the Jays. I&#8217;ll have some more on this topic in the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Zelkovich</strong> <a href=\"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/blogs/eh-game/the-great-canadian-ratings-report--raptors-winning-but-not-feeling-the-love-on-tv-161512244.html\" target=\"_blank\">writes</a> that when it comes to the regular season\u00a0<a data-topotext=\"[{&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;tombstoned&quot;:false,&quot;uniqueId&quot;:2,&quot;paragraphStyle&quot;:{&quot;writingDirection&quot;:1}},&quot;codePoints&quot;:[34,116,104,101,32,82,97,112,116,111,114,115,32,100,114,101,119,32,116,104,101,32,107,105,110,100,32,111,102,32,110,117,109,98,101,114,115,32,117,115,117,97,108,108,121,32,114,101,115,101,114,118,101,100,32,102,111,114,32,115,112,101,101,100,32,115,107,97,116,105,110,103,32,111,114,32,108,117,103,101,46,34]}]\">\u200b</a>&#8220;the Raptors drew the kind of numbers usually reserved for speed skating or luge.&#8221; Here&#8217;s hoping that all turns around starting today. Given that they are playing an afternoon game on the first truly warm day in eons, things may not go so well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>CBC <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cable-costs-cord-cutting-canada-netflix-1.3525949\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that 80% more people cut the cord in 2015 than in 2014. The future is coming more quickly than anticipated. Sporstnet was first out of the gate with their streaming service. I&#8217;ll be curious to see how many people subscribe. As someone who currently spends (and <em><strong>enjoys</strong></em> spending) $110USD every year on MLB&#8217;s streaming service, SN&#8217;s\u00a0service is not priced as outrageously as some of you believe.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PPP</strong> has been struggling a little as they cycle through writers, but they found a gem in the author of this <a href=\"http://www.pensionplanpuppets.com/2016/4/12/11411576/the-grass-is-always-greener-in-toronto\" target=\"_blank\">great piece</a> on where you can gain a financial\u00a0advantage in a salary cap league. Very compelling stuff.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lastly, TSN released a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1SbqqaB\" target=\"_blank\">press document</a> congratulating themselves for winning the Q1 ratings war and recapturing the crown as Canada&#8217;s most watched specialty channel. They also trumpet their web dominance, and the fact that they recorded 5.5. million video views. I&#8217;m willing to bet 90% of those views are from poor saps like me who are slammed with auto-play ads followed by random unwanted content from the moment I click on their website. I update my ad-blockers on a regular basis but both Sportsnet and TSN are always one step ahead in their efforts to make me hate the time I spend on their sites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Low Hanging Fruit</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#8217;s 2016 and people are still saying overtly racist things to on-air staff.

Westhead has been on fire recently, and I have to say that the funniest comment I&#8217;ve seen from a reader was the one who suggested that TSN hired Westhead simply because TSN lost the NHL rights and wanted him to stir up NHL crap. (yeah right).</p>\n<p>Long overdue, but I finally got the chance to &#8220;sit down&#8221; with Ray Ferraro and ask a few questions. Here we go!:</p>\n<p>TSM\tAt what point, if any, during your playing career did you contemplate or even consider a role in the media?</p>\n<p>RF: I got traded from NYR to LA in March 1996. I got a call from ESPN to see if I had any interest in working a playoff round from the studio. I guess it went well, and off I went until I retired in 2002</p>\n<p>TSM\tBesides not being part of the locker-room, what\u2019s been the biggest adjustment to being a member of the media from a player</p>\n<p>RF: Initially I would say learning how to process the information and what to do with it. How to get point across as quickly as possible</p>\n<p>TSM\tMy son and I play a lot of EA\u2019s NHL 16; I mean  A LOT.  What was it like working on a video game?</p>\n<p>RF: It is kinda cool to know so many people play and enjoy the games and my voice is on it. It is long, monotonous at times, to put all that on recorded track. But my biggest kick is that my kids are pretty charged about it.</p>\n<p>TSM\tWhat specific advice did you give your Landon about playing professional hockey and dealing with the media?</p>\n<p>RF: Well there isn&#8217;t 1 piece of advice, it&#8217;s been a 15 year ongoing conversation. He watched me, saw what I worked at, and I&#8217;m proud that I never talk about work ethic with him. As for media, just try to remember they&#8217;re doing their job too, even when it&#8217;s frustrating.</p>\n<p>TSM\tFavorite road cities</p>\n<p>RF: LA, Montreal, Boston</p>\n<p>TSM\tYou have just a little bit of hockey in your life, when not at a rink or doing something hockey related what is it that you are doing?</p>\n<p>RF: I am with my family, 4 boys 27,24,9,6 and Cammi, usually at a soccer pitch or Whitecaps game or at the golf course.</p>\n<p>TSM\tWhat would surprise my readers the most about you that they probably don\u2019t already know?</p>\n<p>RF: Probably a lot. I think fans view people on TV and feel they know them. I&#8217;m actually rather shy in unfamiliar settings, I think I&#8217;m a bit of a softy for older people and love to sit and listen to them. This comes from my incredible blessing of my parents</p>\n<p>TSM\tIf you hadn\u2019t played and then become a member of the media you most likely would have _________________?</p>\n<p>RF: I always assumed I would be a teacher, and a coach of kids</p>\n<p>TSM\tAny aspirations or thoughts about joining the coaching or management ranks?</p>\n<p>RF: I always wanted to coach and get into management. However when I retired, I got divorced that year and my priorities were my older boys. My whole life had been about my career, and I couldn&#8217;t pursue a new career without sacrificing time with them. Then time passes, and here I am. I always harbour thoughts of getting into management somehow</p>\n<p>TSM\tGoing to make it tough, if you could call a game with any broadcaster from any sport, alive or dead, who would it be?</p>\n<p>RF: That&#8217;s not hard at all&#8230;World Series Game 7 from Fenway Park with Vin Scully</p>\n<p>TSM\tSame question from the playing side, if you could play on a team with any player, any sport alive or dead, who would it be?</p>\n<p>RF: I would&#8217;ve played 2nd base for the 1975 Red Sox, batted 2nd with Lynn and Rice right behind me.</p>\n<p>TSM\tIf you didn\u2019t pick a hockey player above, who would it be in hockey?</p>\n<p>RF: Played on Power play with Bobby Orr &#8211; I&#8217;ve dreamed this many times</p>\n<p>TSM\tWhat bothers you the most, or what\u2019s the one thing you would like changed about the game of hockey today?</p>\n<p>RF: Probably the 3 feet around the rink near the boards, and the goal crease grey area. I think we should always aspire for greater safety without the dinosaur thought &#8220;back in the day&#8221;. And the way the goalie interference and what is/isn&#8217;t a goal drives me crazy . I want more goals.</p>\n<p>TSM\tWe hear from time to time that a team has quit on a coach. Given players competitive nature it\u2019s hard to imagine that players aren\u2019t trying.  What\u2019s it look like to you when a team or a player has quit on a coach.</p>\n<p>RF: Lack of energy for a bit of time, no real commitment to hunting the puck. It&#8217;s not a huge difference, but it is noticeable after a while</p>\n<p>TSM\tBest interview you have ever conducted?</p>\n<p>RF: Maybe a sit down with Jagr a couple years ago. My favourite was interviewing Landon in his 1st game with Boston</p>\n<p>TSM\tThe one question or interview you\u2019d like to have a mulligan on?</p>\n<p>RF: Lol .. Probably a lot where I felt like I had marbles in my mouth</p>\n<p>TSM\t1984 you played your first NHL game, ( I was 12) that\u2019s a long time ago, what\u2019s changed the most in the game since then.</p>\n<p>RF: A lot. Defence is king over crating offence. That blocking shots is required not requested even though so many players get hurt blocking needless shots. Thankfully less fighting in areas where it doesn&#8217;t need to be there. Finishing hits 3 seconds late(that NEVER happened in the 80&#8217;s despite fact people somehow think there is less hitting today)</p>\n<p>TSM\tWho was the toughest goalie for you to score on in your career</p>\n<p>RF: Dominik Hasek</p>\n<p>TSM\tDo people still bring up the chicken parm thing?</p>\n<p>RF: In the United States, always</p>\n<p>TSM\tA member of the media recently got criticized for being critical of a current player- and the member of the media who got criticized said that he/she feels that in today&#8217;s world if you aren&#8217;t a former player (as you are), you don&#8217;t get the same discretion to ask or say &#8220;the truth&#8221; as the players feel, &#8220;what do you know, you never played&#8221;. Thoughts?</p>\n<p>RF: I think most media are a bit sensitive. They think it&#8217;s fair game to criticize a player (which is their right) but when someone criticizes their work, they get upset. In a sense it&#8217;s hypocritical. I do find that if I say &#8220;when I played&#8221; , or refer to my career some get offended like I&#8217;m trying to play a trump card. I&#8217;m not. Fact is I did play and my experience separates me(and other former players) from those that didn&#8217;t.  You take your car to a garage and let the guy fix it, I respect that he is doing his job and has experience that separates him. It&#8217;s just fact, doesn&#8217;t mean ex-players are perfect in opinion, but they have been in the situation almost all other media and viewers haven&#8217;t been.</p>\n<p>TSM\tWhat was your biggest highlight and lowlight of your NHL career?</p>\n<p>RF: Highlight?

No preamble this week, except to say that we&#8217;ve adjusted our moderation so that if you use the word &#8220;robbers&#8221; in the comments we\u00a0send your IP address to the police and tell them we are worried you might harm the Ted Rogers statue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With that out of the way, let&#8217;s get to work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>We&#8217;ve Got Mail</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The NHL is being sued by a group of former players. As part of the work product of that case, several hundred emails were subpoenaed. A Minnesota judge recently unsealed those emails. TSN&#8217;s <strong>Rick Westhead</strong>\u00a0was given access to those emails and <a href=\"http://www.tsn.ca/link-between-fighting-concussions-personal-tragedies-discussed-in-unsealed-nhl-emails-1.460651\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> on Monday about what they contain.The Globe&amp;Mail has published the <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/incoming/nhl-unsealed-emails/article29425257/\" target=\"_blank\">entire cache</a> (including emails and phone numbers) if you want to read them. Many other outlets have now picked up the story and are doing their own investigative reporting, including <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2016/03/29/declassified-nhl-memos-put-executive-colin-campbell-harsh-light/49MIZmgv9vMtYwCjfzZRvM/story.html\" target=\"_blank\">AP</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/sports/hockey/nhl-emails-link-concussions-fighting-bettman.html\" target=\"_blank\">NYT</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In brief, the emails include several statements by Daly, Bettman, and other NHL executives\u00a0linking fighting to concussions, and concussions to brain injuries.\u00a0In one particularly damning exchange, one NHL executive says:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The nhl has never been in the business of trying to make the game safer at all levels and we have never tried to sell the fact that this is who we are\u2026 The question is: should we be in that business and if we were, what could we possibly achieve without throwing millions of dollars at education [&#8230;]\u00a0NFL invests hundreds of thousands of dollars each year around their pr campaign to deal with violence \u2026 They produce concussion websites, send former players around teaching young players how to play the game safer, they produce videos for young football players &#8230; I could go on and on &#8230; We do none of that and don\u2019t view it as an important part of our mandate \u2026&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This stands in contrast to Bettman&#8217;s response to an NHL owner who wrote to express concern that the NFL&#8217;s concussion lawsuits could eventually make their way to the NHL:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I do not believe that we are in the same situation as football.\u00a0And I do not believe the NFL lawsuits should put us at risk. Among other things, we have been the leaders in the area of concussions and have set the standard on diagnosis, treatment and rule changes at the professional level.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This story dominated the headlines all week, as different writers delved into the details of the emails and put narratives and timelines together to give them context. Here are some of the best articles that appeared:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/2016/03/30/emails-show-nhl-hindered-by-old-school-hockey-thinking-arthur.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Bruce Arthur</strong></a> &#8211; &#8220;You can see who Gary Bettman has relied on to guide this game, and you can see how often his own vision has been limited to theirs, all these years. The history of hockey is violent and long, and sometimes it can\u2019t see anything beyond its own horizon.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/nhl/in-light-of-nhl-emails-on-player-safety-why-has-the-league-not-banned-fighting\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Scott Stinson</strong></a> &#8211; &#8220;But the argument that player safety is of paramount concern will always ring hollow when those same players are allowed to settle disputes by trying to bash each other in the face.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/the-nhl-needs-to-finally-put-an-end-to-the-concussion-debate/article29427697/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Roy MacGregor</strong></a> &#8211; &#8220;Most significantly, the NHL understood these dangers in 2011, as one e-mail from deputy commissioner Bill Daly clearly links concussions suffered by enforcers to future depression and such \u201cpersonal tragedies\u201d as suffered by the three deceased.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/kelly-unsealed-emails-show-an-nhl-in-midst-of-an-existential-crisis/article29419071/\" target=\"_blank\">Cathal Kelly</a></strong> &#8211; &#8220;There is no longer any point in maintaining Mr. Bettman\u2019s public line \u2013 that we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know, no matter how many broken men come forward to tell the stories of their precipitous late-in-life decline. While there remains some doubt in parts of the research community (because very little can be \u201cdefinitively\u201d proved when it comes to the vagaries of the human mind), there isn\u2019t any left in the real world.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/owners-warned-bettman-over-nhls-concussion-stand-e-mails-reveal/article29459632/\"><strong>James Mirtle</strong></a> &#8211; &#8220;While the attention of many fans since the release of the e-mails has focused on former senior vice-president Colin Campbell\u2019s colourful references to various NHL players as king rats, wusses, punks and dickheads, the meat of the concussion lawsuit will more likely come down to whether the league willfully put players in harm\u2019s way by not being proactive in preventing head injuries.\u00a0What\u2019s clear from these early documents is that some at the ownership level, as far back as five years ago, believed they were not doing enough.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you only have time to read one, make it Arthur&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The emails paint many pictures, but one of the clearest is that the men who run the league have a dim view of their role in making the game safer for the players. Colin Campbell refers to critics of the NHL\u2019s handling of safety issues as \u2018\u2018tree huggers\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Greenpeace pukes\u2019\u2019. It will be hard to square this language with the thesis that the league was proactive in trying to make\u00a0the game as safe as possible for players. The email record shows that, among the most senior members, safety concerns were regarded with contempt and disdain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bettman&#8217;s Long\u00a0Shadow</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The papers all saw this as a major story with significant news value. So did CTV, who devoted lots of time and resources from their news department to TSN&#8217;s investigation. Sportsnet, however, has published a total of 1 story involving original content on this subject as of Friday evening. In his <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/documents-provide-rare-look-inside-nhl-decision-making/\" target=\"_blank\">reporting</a> on the NHL&#8217;s emails <strong>Chris Johnston</strong> writes about the interesting rule changes the league considered, the possibility of scrapping the 3rd point, and lots of other fun tidbits. In other words, he talked about everything but the\u00a0major issue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So while other news organizations focused on the heart and head of the matter, Sportsnet actively avoided talking about it. So did NHL.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s play a quick round of Plausible/Not Plausible. You can play along at home.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>1) Sportsnet didn&#8217;t cover the concussion emails because they don&#8217;t believe they are newsworthy.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Not plausible. This is a story that goes well beyond sports. Sportsnet also covered the NFL concussion lawsuit in depth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Next, consider that <strong>Damien Cox</strong>, <strong>Michael Grange</strong>, <strong>Elliotte Friedman</strong>, and <strong>Stephen Brunt</strong> all wrote stories for Sportsnet.ca this week on other topics. Cox wrote about Jimmy Vesey on Tuesday. Friedman had 30 thoughts, zero of which were about the NHL emails. Grange just last week had <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/football/nfl/nfl-continues-evade-truth-concussions/\" target=\"_blank\">strong words</a> about the NFL&#8217;s concussion issues:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Regardless of who inspired the strategy or if there was one, the league didn\u2019t do a very good job trying to protect the health of its players, even as they were being forced out of the sport earlier than they wanted and against their will, and even as documentation began to pile up that long-term effects of those brain injuries could be deadly.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yet, despite finding time for 3 Raptors stories, he failed to mention the emails. Stephen Brunt, someone who at one time was the sports conscience of the nation, wrote about Robert Osuna. If you want to know what Brunt thinks about Bettman these days you can read his 2014\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/is-gary-bettman-the-best-boss-in-pro-sports/\" target=\"_blank\">piece</a> titled: &#8220;Is Gary Bettman the best boss in pro sports?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Verdict? This was a major story that went undiscussed by the major people at Sportsnet. In each case, the writers in question\u00a0chose other topics over this one. This leads us to out next question.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2) Cox, Grange, Friedman, and Brunt all decided of their own volition to avoid writing about the major story of the week involving Canada&#8217;s national sport.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Not plausible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All of these people cover hockey (among other sports) and many of these same people have written extensively about concussions, the NHL, and general business of sports issues. This story should be in their wheelhouses. So, the fact that none of them wrote about it is striking.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The most plausible explanation for all of them writing about other topics is that they were told not to write about the emails. Next question:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3)\u00a0Scott Moore decided on his own to forbid his employees from writing anything that could draw negative attention to the NHL.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Not plausible. Moore runs a sports media company that employs hundreds of people in a journalistic capacity. Presumably he values their skills as journalists. He&#8217;s not going to start meddling in their affairs based on his own hunches and intuitions. He&#8217;s not a journalist. The much more plausible explanation is that Gary asked Moore to issue the coverage ban.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you put all of this together the result is that Bettman more likely than not exercised influence over Rogers management who in turn exercised editorial control over Sportsnet&#8217;s corps of writers by placing the emails off limits. If you&#8217;re Gary this makes a lot of sense:\u00a0just as the commissioner\u00a0is not going to say anything that could be damaging to the league in its legal fight with the ex-players, neither should the league&#8217;s media partners at Rogers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This makes no sense if you run a sports network. <strong>Why hire all of these respected journalists if you are not going to put them to work on the most important stories?\u00a0</strong>This is precisely the kind of story where you want to call on their skill and talent to treat the issues seriously and with tact.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For contrast, consider these\u00a0quotes from when the infamous Rogers/NHL deal was signed.\u00a0As <strong>Sean Fitz-Gerald</strong> <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/nhl/what-the-nhl-deal-with-rogers-means-to-the-cbc-don-cherry-and-the-quebec-nordiques\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;There was some friendly banter near the end of the news conference on Tuesday, when host \u2014\u00a0and Sportsnet veteran \u2014\u00a0Daren Millard took a gentle jab at the NHL\u2019s troubled franchises in the United States.\u00a0\u201cYou now have to play nice,\u201d Bettman said, to laughter in the room.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s going to take some getting used to, OK,\u201d Millard said.\u00a0\u201c<em><strong>Well, you\u2019d better get used to it quick</strong></em>,\u201d Bettman said.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That raised a follow-up question from the floor about the freedom Sportsnet journalists will have to question the NHL, when so much money has been tied into the two groups.\u00a0\u201cThe No. 1 thing is maintaining journalistic integrity,\u201d Pelley said.\u00a0\u201cAnd we would insist on nothing less,\u201d Bettman said. \u201cOur fans want authenticity. <em><strong>We never control the coverage of our game</strong></em> \u2014\u00a0which is obvious by some of the treatment.\u201d&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is something unsettling\u00a0about this seemingly lighthearted exchange as we look at it retrospect. Essentially we were being told exactly what would take place under the terms of the partnership, and we had better get used to it quick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Evaluating the Evidence</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since Rogers took over there have not been many stories that we could\u00a0use as barometers for whether Sportsnet has accepted a soft journalistic approach to its coverage of the NHL.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One piece of evidence is <strong>Ron MacLean</strong>&#8216;s relegation to media Siberia following his history of, shall we say, &#8220;challenging&#8221; interviews with Gary. No one except a handful of people knows for sure, but the common view in the industry is that Gary demanded that Rogers move MacLean out of the host chair as part of their negotiations on the $5.2 billion dollar exclusive national rights deal. Bringing in Strombo makes a certain kind of sense if you are hoping to broaden your base outside of the traditional hockey fan, but essentially cutting one of the established faces of your brand out of the playoffs makes very little sense as a broadcast move. It does make sense if the goal is to celebrate the game and you think MacLean won&#8217;t go along with that mandate as a host.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, it must be noted that Sportsnet has not totally shied away from the other issues that have cropped up over the last 20 months. <a href=\"http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/voynov-case-could-leave-kings-in-cap-limbo/\" target=\"_blank\">Here&#8217;s</a> <strong>Chris Johnston</strong> writing about the Voynov case, though he spends a lot of the piece praising the NHL for its swift action. But they did cover it. Could Sportsnet have spent more time raking the commish over the coals for his not so subtly racially\u00a0charged <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/2014/10/9/6952037/gary-bettman-quote-nhl-arrests-nfl-c\" target=\"_blank\">comment</a> that &#8220;our players know what&#8217;s right and wrong&#8221;? Maybe. However, the lack of coverage of the NHL emails is so complete that it slaps you right in the face. There simply is no more plausible explanation than that Sportsnet took its editorial marching orders\u00a0from the NHL.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Scott Moore and his new boss Rick Brace are playing a very dangerous game by acquiescing to Gary&#8217;s law.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>First</strong>, the NHL is just one property among many in the sports landscape. In 10 years time, under different leadership and with a changing demographic landscape, Rogers may move on from its exclusive rights deal. What happens then? If you have destroyed the credibility of your network during that time, then this genuflection might not turn out to be worth it. Better to maintain consistent standards regardless of which rights you control.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, you are one of the biggest employers of sports journalism in North America. Presumably you want to attract the best to your network, and keep them away from the competition. If you start to become known as the network where you have the check your journalistic ethics at the door, that might affect the kind of talent you can attract and keep.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Third</strong>, think about what you are doing to the reputation of the people who already work there. If you&#8217;re Shi Davidi and you have worked hard to overcome the perception that you&#8217;re a house reporter, this has to hurt. The Rogers/NHL deal has nothing to do with Shi, but he\u00a0will be caught in its undertow. Further, Sportsnet\u00a0wants to be able to deploy Grange and Brunt and others to cover other sports beyond the NHL. That&#8217;s part of why you paid them big bucks to get out of the newspaper industry. But if you tarnish their reputation by capitulating to Gary&#8217;s demands, then you also diminish their value in all the other work they\u00a0do.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Where do we go from here?</strong> Well, this ought to affect how we view Sportsnet&#8217;s NHL coverage going forward. This has undermined the network&#8217;s credibility as a whole. I am loath to declare that the writers in question should all be viewed with suspicion. I have no idea how hard they fought this. Based on their bodies of work, I suspect they don&#8217;t like being told what they can and cannot write about.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I hope this doesn&#8217;t set a precedent. The absolute worst thing for the audience is leagues using rights as leverage over news departments. We saw a glimpse of this in the NFL&#8217;s attempt to squash the League of Denial documentary. If anything, ESPN has been even more vigilant about shining a spotlight on the league&#8217;s problems since then. The NFL&#8217;s own network has been vocal in criticizing Goodell, as have people working at NBC, CBS, and Fox. But the NFL has many media partners and this diffuses their ability to keep people on message. By contrast, Gary has one national partner for a whole country.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regardless of which network you cheer for, I think we can all agree that Gary&#8217;s &#8220;all or nothing&#8221; strategy is dangerous if it leads to networks controlling their journalists on behalf of their league partners. Journalists\u00a0need their bosses fighting on their behalf, and by extension, on behalf of the audience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sportsnet, and Rogers by extension, failed their employees by allowing Gary to set editorial policy. They also failed their customers and the sports public at large. Let&#8217;s hope this is the slap in the face that wakes everyone up. Let&#8217;s hope this is not a glimpse into the future of sports media.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Does the Shoe Fit?</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I spoke to many people in the industry this week and one of the talking points that came up was: <strong>would TSN do anything differently if the shoe were on the other foot? </strong>In other words, if TSN had the NHL deal, would they be telling McKenzie and Dreger not to talk about concussions?\u00a0This is obviously a hypothetical question we cannot answer definitively. One thing we can do is look at the evidence we do have before us now.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Item 1:</strong> TSN is owned by Bell who also own a chunk of the Leafs. The Leafs are one of the teams that stand to be hurt by the concussion litigation. Yet TSN has been pumping out stories and features on the effects of concussions on players. (<em>Note</em>: the <a href=\"http://longform.tsn.ca/lifetime-penalty\" target=\"_blank\">Lifetime Penalty</a> feature is very hard to find on TSN&#8217;s useless website, but is definitely worth your time).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Item 2:</strong> TSN has an exclusive and tight relationship with the CFL yet have <a href=\"http://fw.to/6DR3AmI\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> critical stories about the league. They could probably be more critical, but we\u00a0have some evidence that when the story is big enough, it will be discussed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Item 3:</strong> Bell recently <a href=\"http://torontosportsmedia.com/sports-and-toronto/seen-heard-weekend-edition-51/19863\" target=\"_blank\">fired</a> its President for trying to meddle with the newsroom. I have no idea if the sports section is held to the same standards, but this is at least some evidence that corporate meddling is not tolerated (when it is egregious and public).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is an open question whether Bell has different sensibilities than Rogers when it comes to the relationship between their business side and their media/news side. Only people who have worked both places would be able to speak to that.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I am not so naive as to think business interests <em>never</em> shape media coverage. The important question is whether news value trumps business interests on the stories that matter the most. I contend this is one of those stories, and Rogers went with business instead. Sure, it&#8217;s not voter fraud or political corruption\u00a0or some other story where massive\u00a0public goods are at stake. But human lives have been, and may continue to be,\u00a0shattered by brain disease from playing a sport we all watch. That&#8217;s a news story to me.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Two more things.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1) There is a spectrum of possible approaches Sportsnet could have taken. At one end is devoting its full resources to covering this story, and leaving no stone unturned. At the other end is burying the story. This latter path is the one\u00a0they have chosen. A better option was available to them. Go to Elliotte or Brunt and say &#8220;listen, we need you to cover this. Be fair, be a journalist, but remember these are our partners and avoid taking any cheap shots.&#8221; If you go this route you avoid much of\u00a0the criticism that the NHL is pulling the strings at your network.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) On the substantive issue of the league&#8217;s liability for players&#8217; brain injuries, here is a POV I heard a lot this week:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m sorry, I never will buy into the idea that guys who played <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NHL?src=hash\">#NHL</a> hockey didn&#39;t understand the risks, especially fighters. Ask any boxer.</p>\n<p>&mdash; steve buffery (@Beezersun) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Beezersun/status/715765801333211138\">April 1, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are a couple of reasons why I disagree with this.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>First</strong>, ask any parent if they have qualms about their kids playing hockey, and you&#8217;ll get a mixed response. Ask them if they would let their kids box, and the answer will be mostly negative. But a central\u00a0point of\u00a0this lawsuit is to find out if we should have the same attitude towards hockey as we do towards boxing. That&#8217;s something for which the league is responsible, and the players have a case if they can show that the league was negligent in its duty to find out what the true risks of its product are.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, the tort of negligence is not an &#8220;all or nothing&#8221; proposition in most jurisdictions. You can say the players are partly to blame without exonerating the league. In other words, both may have been negligent in their duties of care, and this will reduce the damages the league must pay if they are found to be liable. But to suggest you have to pick one side over the other is not true. You can choose to blame both, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the league is off the hook financially.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Quick Hits</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The New York Times and the NFL are at war over the facts\u00a0surrounding the\u00a0league&#8217;s\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2016/03/8595251/new-york-times-wont-retract-or-post-correction-nfl-story\" target=\"_blank\">concussion story</a>.

This week some top women&#8217;s soccer players are thinking of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-women-carli-lloyd-alex-morgan-hope-solo-complain.html\" target=\"_blank\">suing their employer</a> based on wage discrimination, citing the fact that they earn way less than their much less successful make counterparts.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div>In a move aimed at cord-cutters, Rogers has decided to <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com//report-on-business/rogers-launches-direct-to-consumers-sportsnet-now-streaming-service/article29471799/\" target=\"_blank\">offer</a> its suite of Sportsnet TV channels as a streaming service without a cable subscription. This is a bold move since sports is supposed to the lure that forces people into buying expensive packages and renting digital boxes, and signing up for bundles for cell service.

I&#8217;m looking for story ideas so if you have some topic you want to see covered here, please be in touch (<em>note</em>: you can DM me even if we&#8217;re not following each other). Also, if you&#8217;re in the industry and want to get something off your chest, we have ways of making that happen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Because It&#8217;s 2016 &#8230;</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of all the topics we cover in this space, the ones we discuss the most pertain to the intersection of sports and social issues. Of those issues, sexism, racism, and homophobia stand out as the most important. The reason is that sports is reliably\u00a0lagging behind the rest of society. So even though we are in 2016, there is still a need to shine a light into the corners of the sports world where these problems continue to lurk. Baseball fought the integration of black players. Just last month we learned of a baseball prospect quitting after his coach <a href=\"http://www.outsports.com/2016/3/24/11301036/baseball-coach-colorado-mesa-gay\" target=\"_blank\">talked</a> about killing gay people. We don&#8217;t have openly gay current players in most professional sports. And it wasn&#8217;t that long ago that one of the world&#8217;s most famous golf courses banned women.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The news isn&#8217;t all bad, of course. The NFL <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2014/02/26/nfl-discusses-moving-super-bowl-from-arizona-over-anti-gay-law/\" target=\"_blank\">pressured</a> Arizona to drop some anti-LGBT legislation by threatening to move the SuperBowl. Some teams are doing the same with respect to a <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2627653-hornets-issue-statement-regarding-north-carolinas-transgender-law\" target=\"_blank\">similar law</a>\u00a0passed by North Carolina. The You Can Play project has seen <a href=\"http://youcanplayproject.org/videos/c/hockey\" target=\"_blank\">some\u00a0uptake</a> by individual professional teams as well as the CFL, MLS, NHL, and their respective players&#8217; associations. But the existence of good news doesn&#8217;t make the bad news any easier to accept. And the bad news when it comes to sexism has been an ongoing story in several leagues in recent months.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an abbreviated list: the NFL&#8217;s initial lax treatment of Ray Rice punching his girlfriend into unconsciousness, the same casual attitude towards Greg Hardy&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/greg-hardy-domestic-violence-incident-photos-nicole-holder-2015-11\" target=\"_blank\">domestic violence</a>, the LA Kings&#8217; <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/as-voynov-leaves--la-kings-remain-tone-deaf-on-domestic-violence-061142528.html\" target=\"_blank\">laissez-faire approach</a> to the Voynov assault, and Gary Bettman&#8217;s trademark <a href=\"http://www.sportingnews.com/nhl-news/4642548-gary-bettman-sexism-comments-winnipeg-jets-fans-katy-perry-chant-corey-perry\" target=\"_blank\">disingenuous response</a> to the Corey/Katy Perry chants. PPP also writes about, among other related issues, a recent Chicago BlackHawk prospect being charged for <a href=\"http://www.pensionplanpuppets.com/2016/3/23/11288820/women-in-hockey-being-heard-but-not-loud-enough\" target=\"_blank\">revenge porn</a>. (<em>note</em>: comments are closed on this thread at PPP.\u00a0Attempts to ascertain the reasons why were ignored by their Site Manager. Feel free to comment here.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All of this serves as the background to the big story of the week. The CEO of the Indian Wells tennis tournament <span class=\"Apple-style-span\"><strong>Raymond Moore</strong>\u00a0</span>said some sexist things, and later resigned. The BBC has a great <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/35868662\" target=\"_blank\">breakdown</a> of the issues.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are the relevant quotes:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">In my next life when I come back I want to be someone in the WTA because they ride on the coattails of the men. They don\u2019t make any decisions and they are lucky. They are very, very lucky. If I was a lady player, I\u2019d go down every night on my knees and thank God that Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal were born, because they have carried this sport.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">He also referred to women&#8217;s players as &#8220;physically attractive and competitively attractive&#8221; while talking about the future of women&#8217;s tennis, referencing Genie Bouchard and others.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When asked to comment on Moore&#8217;s remarks, Novak Djokovic said many things, including this:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&#8220;I applaud them for that, I honestly do. They fought for what they deserve and they got it. On the other hand I think that our men\u2019s tennis world, ATP world, should fight for more because the stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men\u2019s tennis matches. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why maybe we should get awarded more. Women should fight for what they think they deserve and we should fight for what we think we deserve.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Seems like a reasonable argument. He also said this:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">I have tremendous respect for what women in global sport are doing and achieving. Their bodies are much different to men\u2019s bodies. They have to go through a lot of different things that we don\u2019t have to go through. You know, the hormones and different stuff, we don\u2019t need to go into details.\u00a0I have great admiration and respect for them to be able to fight on such a high level. Many of them have to sacrifice for certain periods of time, the family time or decisions that they make on their own bodies in order to play tennis and play professional sport. \u2026\u00a0I\u2019m completely for women power.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Oh boy. Let&#8217;s separate out two issues:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. Pay Equity</p>\n<p>2. Sex appeal in sports</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These are distinct issues and you can have no problem with the\u00a0second and lots of problems with the\u00a0first, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s deal with the first: <strong>should women stars be paid the same as their male counterparts?</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In most\u00a0other sports this would\u00a0seem ridiculous but in tennis it is not. Have a look at the BBC article for some relevant data. As a complete outsider, it seems plausible to me that the star system in tennis is cyclical. In an ideal world there will be stars in both at all times. In reality, women will be be the stars at times and men will be stars at times. \u00a0Pay equity in the most lucrative tournaments seems like a reasonable solution to the ebb and flow of the sport.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I can understand the argument that purses should be relative to ticket sales for all events, including the majors. After all we don&#8217;t expect WNBA stars to make the same as NBA stars. But it is hard to compare tennis to any other sport. It&#8217;s an individual game not a team game, so likening men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s tennis to the NBA and WNBA\u00a0doesn&#8217;t work. However, tennis is also\u00a0not like golf where your main competition is with the course, not your opponents. It&#8217;s also not like golf in that the men and women tour together for majors and other tournaments. Since individual fates are very much intermixed in tennis, pay equity at the most popular tournaments seems like a decent solution. There is room for reasonable disagreement on this issue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On to the second:<strong> is there a problem with marketing sex appeal in sports?</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All things considered the answer has to be: no. These are among the most fit humans in the world. Their bodies are amazing. I have no problem with individuals choosing to draw attention to their physique. Where it becomes problematic is when a league decides to use that as its marketing technique. I&#8217;m sure the women who signed up to play in the Lingerie Football League knew what they were getting in to. The fact that some of them are very good at playing football is secondary. This is not at all the case with the WTA. So for Moore to suggest that the league should start focusing the attention on how attractive their players are is demeaning to the athletes who compete in that league.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Again, to be clear: there is nothing wrong with Anna Kournikova building a fortune based on her looks rather than her tennis skills. The problem is with a highly paid and powerful tennis\u00a0executive publicly arguing that this is what all women in the sport should be doing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Over to you</strong></span>: for those of you who actually follow the sport, how representative of general sentiment are Moore &amp; Djokovic&#8217;s comments? Is there merit to the argument that since women play best of 3 while men play best of 5, men deserve to be paid more?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>McCown&#8217;s Moral Progress?</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Indian Wells fiasco brought to mind some similar comments by Sportsnet host\u00a0<strong>Bob McCown</strong> in 2011. On International Women&#8217;s Day (March 8th of 2011) McCown went on air at 3pm and began his show by talking about women in sports. As you&#8217;ll recall, moving PTS to 3-6pm and replaying the 5 o&#8217;clock hour from 6 to 7pm was a Kollins Genius Idea\u2122. This decision came after\u00a0he opted to hire Andrew Krystal to host the morning show, another KGI\u2122. By March of 2011 Krystal was hosting 1-3pm, and he regularly\u00a0joined Bob for a cross-over segment (KGI\u2122).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The two hosts discussed the state of women&#8217;s sports for roughly 20 minutes. The podcast of the show has been lost in the sands of time (<em>note</em>: <em>I&#8217;ll make a donation to your favourite charity if you find and send me the audio</em>) but some of Bob&#8217;s\u00a0remarks were recorded for posterity. Here&#8217;s a sampling\u00a0of McCown&#8217;s\u00a0thoughts:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">The sole motivation for a man to watch any sport is: Are [the women]\u00a0half naked and are they good-looking?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&#8220;I have never seen a female volleyball player I would consider attractive. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re all dogs, or butch, but they\u2019re not overwhelming. Women\u2019s hockey, I would never watch because you can\u2019t see them.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p><span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&#8220;You don\u2019t get enough close-ups in soccer to see if they\u2019re attractive or not.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Dave Bidini</strong> in the National Post has a <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/dave-bidini-only-in-it-for-the-jiggle\" target=\"_blank\">commentary</a> on Bob&#8217;s remarks, including the parts where McCown\u00a0discussed &#8220;<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">Gabriella Sabatini\u2019s nipples, her sweat, likening her competitive look to a wet T-shirt contest.&#8221; Readers on this site also <a href=\"http://torontosportsmedia.com/sports-and-toronto/bikini-otd-sports-radio-tonight-427/10241\" target=\"_blank\">discussed</a> the <a href=\"http://torontosportsmedia.com/sports-and-toronto/tuesday-toronto-sports-media/10281\" target=\"_blank\">comments</a>.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bob appears to have revised his view of things in the intervening 5 years. The always excellent <strong>Christine Brennan</strong> (USA Today) appeared on PTS on Monday (March 21, 6pm hour &#8211; Shannon warning!) to discuss Moore&#8217;s remarks and succinctly articulated why they were sexist and unacceptable. Bob noted in response that &#8220;any right thinking person&#8221; would agree with her.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a slightly\u00a0uncomfortable\u00a0segue, <strong>Bob Ryan</strong> was the next guest and said we should not be surprised at the dumb things executives say when it comes to gender. Ryan also appears to have evolved\u00a0since he <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=99684\" target=\"_blank\">famously</a> said that a prominent\u00a0NBA player&#8217;s wife should be smacked, and refused to retract the comment when given the opportunity to do so. (As an aside, PTS should move on from Ryan as a paid guest. He&#8217;s incoherent most of the time.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It would have been illuminating\u00a0to hear Bob explain his change of stance on women&#8217;s sports. While he claimed to have been joking when he made the sexist comments in 2011, the content of what he said speaks for itself. As far as I know he never apologized for saying those things. So as a listener I am unsure whether Bob has genuinely changed his stance or not.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Naylor &amp; Landsberg\u00a0had a great segment with <strong>Howard Bryant</strong> (ESPN) on the Moore comments (March 21, Hour 3).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Freelancers</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nice to see\u00a0<strong>Eric Koreen</strong>\u00a0getting more venues for his excellent writing.

Thanks for dropping by. Please contribute to the conversation by commenting below. As always, you can DM (even if we&#8217;re not following each other) or email to let me know of any story ideas or errors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The big news of the week was the cutting of the Sportsnet Pacific bureau. This move means job losses for some recognizable on air personalities as well as the behind the scenes production team. Regular readers know that we focus mostly on radio and print in this space, so I decided to reach out to someone who understands the TV side of the business to help break down what this move means for Sportsnet and the industry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Jim Van Horne</strong> worked at TSN as a sports anchor from 1984 to 2001, and then at Sportsnet from 2003-2006. He is currently the television coordinator at the <a href=\"http://www.collegeofsportsmedia.com/instructors.html\" target=\"_blank\">College of Sports Media</a>. Here is our conversation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>5 Questions with Jim Van Horne</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: You started at TSN in 1984. How radical was the idea of 24 hour a day sports back then?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>JVH:</strong> Nobody thought it would work. The first reaction I heard was &#8220;what are they going to show, Tiddlywinks?&#8221; \u2026 People laughed at us when we would show up at press conferences with our TSN jackets on. It&#8217;s changed a little bit since then.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: How quickly could you tell that this model was viable?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>JVH:</strong> To be honest I felt it right away when they approached me to join the network. For TSN itself, I think you would have to point to the 1988 Olympics in Calgary when people in the industry really recognized that we were serious and could do good work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: How do you see the place of the traditional sports desk type show in 2016?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>JVH:</strong> When I first started doing it back in 1984 there was no internet so people had 3 places to go for sports news: TV, radio, or print. And if they wanted it immediately then they would go for TV or radio. So back then we were the main places for up to the minute info. For lack of a better term, it was a much more closed society. Today it&#8217;s completely different. I think the role of the sports anchor has changed where the audience is not relying on it as much as they used to. It&#8217;s certainly reduced the importance of the highlight show. Whether it will ever go away? I don&#8217;t think so. It will just become more of a niche product.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: How did you approach your role? Did you try to give the audience access to your personality?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>JVH:</strong> Sports differs from news in that you can add a little personality. I&#8217;ve never been one to believe that I was the star of the show; I was more of the conduit. Every once in a while I would throw something humorous in but I was more interested in letting the viewer or the listener soak it in. I wasn&#8217;t trying to pretend to be an expert.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: Some of the people I speak with in the industry complain that sports anchors now are mostly just in the business of reading teleprompters and are much less knowledgeable than people on radio or in print. Do you think that is accurate?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>JVH:</strong> I never considered myself a news-reader. I always did my own research. I spent a lot of time during the day on the phone calling agents and teams and getting information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: Shifting to the news of the week, Sportsnet has shut its Vancouver office. This struck me as an odd move for a network that is pitching itself as a national broadcaster. How do you see the relevance of regional bureaus for sports networks?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>JVH:</strong>\u00a0The reporters are still there and will be filing stores for SN. So it&#8217;s not like they are shutting down Vancouver. They&#8217;re just switching to the same model as TSN, who have had reporters in Vancouver since day one but never had a bureau there. This is just a cost-cutting measure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: What&#8217;s the loss to the consumer by shifting the entire operation to Toronto?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>JVH:</strong> The loss to the Sportsnet Pacific viewer is that they no longer have a show that is primarily focused on their market. That&#8217;s not to say they won&#8217;t get their share of coverage. When I was at Sportsnet we would do 5 different versions of the show a night. We catered very show to the market, so the lead story in Toronto wasn&#8217;t necessarily the same everywhere. They are still going to get their coverage, but it&#8217;s a perception they are losing the Western focus. They aren&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: With the recent job losses in print many people decried the centralization of news offices. CBC referred to this as &#8220;news poverty&#8221; when local communities lose their own offices. So at least outside of sports some people are really worried about the loss of local news.</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>JVH:</strong> Oh sure. If you shut down a station then you certainly lose. And people want to be informed and need to be informed. But it&#8217;s different with sports. Sports takes us away from our every day anxiety. And even though there are billions at stake, it&#8217;s still entertainment. So Sportsnet is not closing down anything. And this is a phenomenon that is happening across both BCE and Rogers as they try to adjust.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: Do you think the sports media industry has been slow to adjust to the changing economy around how people get their sports news? Both networks hired a ton of people to generate content for their websites and channels, and now they are cutting back. Did they overextend themselves?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>JVH:</strong> No, I don&#8217;t think so. They expanded at the rate they thought was appropriate. Nobody expected TSN to be as successful as it turned out to be. If you look at the industry here and in the US where you have so many regional networks, the popularity of sports is incredible. It&#8217;s all about live event programming. So I think the cuts we are seeing is about the maturing of the medium itself. It&#8217;s the industry trying to evolve. And the job losses are a tragedy. I tell my students every day, the industry will always crave good people. But, the days where mere rudimentary knowledge of the basics of writing and broadcasting are enough are long gone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: Are there too many people going to school for broadcast jobs?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>JVH:</strong> I don&#8217;t think so. One of the good things is that people quickly discover that being able to talk sports with your buddies and being good on air are totally different. And lots can&#8217;t do it. So they start to work on other skills, like editing, directing, producing, camera \u2026 so a lot of them will become very good at the behind the scenes stuff. But to be honest I don&#8217;t think there are enough good broadcasters to fill the existing jobs in this country.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: Nelson Millman once told me he thinks one of the biggest problems is that we don&#8217;t have a farm system in this country. Do you agree?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>JVH:</strong> Absolutely. And adding to what Nelson said, I think a lot of broadcasters coming out of school today have the expectation that their degree will get them a job at the majors right away. And that&#8217;s just not going to happen. But you need to get experience. And it takes a lot of time. I was in the business for 15 years before getting my break at TSN. There are very few people who can step in to that job right out of the gate. It takes time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: Does Canada lack a national sports culture? In the US there are several national radio shows \u2013 guys like Rome, Mike&amp;Mike, Cowherd, Patrick \u2013 while we don&#8217;t have anything close to that here. Outside of the Olympics, the World Juniors, and maybe the Grey Cup, are there many sports topics that you can discuss coast to coast?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>JVH:</strong> Outside of hockey, I think you&#8217;re right that we don&#8217;t have much to unify the country. We tried it on the TEAM [sports radio network] when CHUM still owned it and it never worked. We tried to be national but I think sports radio in this country is more regional than anything else. People in Toronto want to talk about the Jays and the Leafs. If you&#8217;re in Montreal, you hate the Leafs and only want to talk Habs or other local stories. I think it&#8217;s the same across the country. It&#8217;s interesting you mentioned the personalities from south of the border. We don&#8217;t have anything like Jim Rome in Canada. I&#8217;ll give you an example. Stephen Brunt and I\u00a0 interviewed Martha Burk who led the protests against Augusta golf course for excluding women. At the end she said &#8220;I&#8217;m really shocked. Whenever I go on a radio show in the US they are screaming and yelling at me and trying to put me down, but we had a sane conversation here.&#8221; Welcome to Canada. So I think there is a difference in how we do things here. There&#8217;s not as much appetite for that style.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Q: The rivalry between TSN and SN is pretty intense right now. When you were at TSN the network was clobbering SN. Are you surprised they have caught up?</strong></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>JVH:</strong> Not at all. Years ago SN was worried about what TSN was doing. They would react. Today SN is marching to the beat of their own drum. They don&#8217;t care what TSN is doing, and that change came when Pelley and Moore took over. They decided they didn&#8217;t want to run scared anymore. Of course they were both trained at TSN so they knew exactly what they wanted to active, plus for all the grief they are taking over the NHL ratings, do you think it&#8217;s a coincidence that they pulled ahead when they got the NHL package? Of course not. And all the griping about the coverage would be way less if the Canadian teams were doing well. If your team is winning you wouldn&#8217;t care who is calling the games. But don&#8217;t forget that even though TSN doesn&#8217;t have the national rights, they also aren&#8217;t paying that huge sum of money that SN is. They are free\u00a0to buy other rights and make money off those.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thanks to Jim for taking the time. It&#8217;s great to hear from someone who knows the business so well, and from both sides. Follow Jim on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jvanh\" target=\"_blank\">@jvanh</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Forum: Coast to Coast?</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have been hanging on to this topic for a while and now seems as good a time as any to roll it out. Here&#8217;s the question I&#8217;d like us to discuss this weekend: <strong>why are there no national sports radio shows in Canada?</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the nice things about travelling through the States is that whether you&#8217;re in Texas or in Florida or in Oregon you can flip on the radio in your rental car and find a recognizable voice talking about sports topics that aren&#8217;t the local college teams. Not only that, but if you don&#8217;t like Rome, then you can usually flip around and find Patrick or Cowherd or some other national voice. This is an embarrassment of riches for the sports fan on the move. The other thing this does is expose you to stories from other parts of the country that you would miss if all that existed was local sports talk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The striking thing is that we don&#8217;t have anything remotely close to that in Canada. With all due respect to <strong>Bob McCown</strong>, PTS is on a small handful of stations, and the only major one outside of Ontario is in Calgary\u00a0where Rogers&#8217; other all-sports station carries the 6pm hour. So despite the claims that the show is on &#8220;coast to coast&#8221; that&#8217;s pretty far from the truth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What I would like to discuss is why this is the case. As Jim mentioned, the TEAM sports network tried to have a national sports conversation and it failed. We can discuss the reasons why that whole experiment was dead in the water some other time. <strong>Stephen Brunt</strong> got a nice house in Newfoundland out of the deal, so it wasn&#8217;t a total loss. The specific topic I want to focus on is why Canadians seem to have little appetite for what is going on in other markets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m always shocked that Jim Rome will spend twenty minutes talking to the Kansas University basketball coach in January. I could not possibly care less about this but evidently that is not a turn off for most of the audience. Can you imagine a national sports radio show in Canada spending time interviewing a 3rd line player on the Edmonton Oilers? Or the head coach of the Alouettes? Why would anyone outside of those markets\u00a0care to listen? Yet somehow the American shows are able to devote time\u00a0to\u00a0local stories\u00a0despite having a national platform. <strong>Why does that work?</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The other reason this is interesting to ponder is that TSN now has seven all-sports radio stations across the country, spanning Montreal to Vancouver. So they are in a good position to try out having a national sports conversation. It would be interesting to see them try a radio version of The Reporters where they try to generate an interesting national conversation between local stations. I wonder if Canadians would go for it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over to you: <strong>would you listen to a national Canadian version of Mike&amp;Mike or Dan Patrick? If not, why not?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Quick Hits</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://www.gammonsdaily.com/peter-gammons-jose-bautista-and-the-future-of-athletic-preparation-and-longevity/\" target=\"_blank\">Gammons piece</a> on Bautista there is the following buried nugget: &#8220;Understand that Jose Bautista was a 20th round draft pick in 2000 who after being waived, Rule Fived, bounced in a three-way trade, waived, claimed\u2026then, in his 11th professional season, hit 54 home runs, <em><strong>only to have a blogger who\u2019d never met him suggest it must have been steroids.</strong></em>&#8221; Is this a reference to <strong>Damien Cox</strong> and his &#8220;gotta ask the question!&#8221; routine from a few years back?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Richard Deitsch</strong> at SI ran a series of <a href=\"http://www.si.com/more-sports/2016/03/06/erin-andrews-trial-women-media-safety\" target=\"_blank\">interviews</a> he did with female sports reporters and broadcasters on how the Erin Andrews case has affected their personal safety habits while on the road. Chilling stuff. The NY Times also <a href=\"http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/sports/erin-andrews-dangers-of-being-female-sportscaster.html\" target=\"_blank\">weighs in</a>. As digital privacy has dominated the news lately with Apple v FBI this underlines\u00a0just how damaging a loss of privacy can be to a person&#8217;s well-being, and\u00a0also the deep\u00a0connection between privacy and personal security.

As we have discussed before, some logos are clearly racist while others are less so, and lumping them all together muddies the waters when trying to debate the issue. It&#8217;s striking that this conversation has been going on for decades now with very little actual change. We still have the Redskins, Braves, Eskimos, Indians, etc. It will be interesting to see which league/city/team is the first to come out and say that it is time to retire its logo and try something new.

Landsberg also botched his first question but the overall interview was much better. Naylor came equipped with examples and distinctions that helped draw Gossage out a bit more. But the end result was largely the same: a pretty dim guy contradicting himself left and right and getting angry when pushed on it.\u00a0Spring training can&#8217;t end soon enough.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They say great minds think alike:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Excellent points 2day from the great Goose Gossage about the out-of-control Bautista.
