The actress &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/haydenpanettier/status/730854394770673665&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;took to Twitter on Thursday to announce the news&lt;/a&gt;, saying, &quot;The postpartum depression I have been experiencing has impacted every aspect of my life. Rather than stay stuck due to unhealthy coping mechanisms I have chosen to take time to reflect holistically on my health and life. Wish me luck!&quot; The same day Hayden made her announcement, it was also revealed that her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/ABC-Cancels-Nashville-41295954&quot; &gt;ABC show Nashville had been cancelled&lt;/a&gt; after four seasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hayden first opened up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Hayden-Panettiere-Battling-Postpartum-Depression-38764286&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;about her struggles with postnatal depression&lt;/a&gt; in October, nearly a year after giving birth to her daughter, Kaya. At the time, her rep confirmed to &lt;strong&gt;People&lt;/strong&gt; that she would be receiving treatment, and Hayden had been vocal about her battle, saying in an interview, &quot;Women need to know that they&#039;re not alone, and that it does heal.&quot; In January, she &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Hayden-Panettiere-Critics-Choice-Awards-2016-39840561&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made her return to the red carpet at the Critics&#039; Choice Awards&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Hayden-Panettiere-Wladimir-Klitschko-After-Treatment-39237187&quot; &gt;supported her fianc\u00e9, Wladimir Klitschko&lt;/a&gt;, at his boxing match in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As recently as March, Hayden seemed to be gaining control of her depression and hoping to inspire other women to be equally brave. During &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Hayden-Panettiere-Talks-About-Postpartum-Depression-2016-40678373&quot; &gt;an interview with People&lt;/a&gt;, the 26-year-old revealed that she had &quot;been trying to be much more open and honest about who I am,&quot; adding, &quot;I&#039;m an adult, and [I don&#039;t] have to falsify who I am.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <comments>http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Hayden-Panettiere-Treatment-Postnatal-Depression-2016-41300151#comment</comments>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Celebrity Twitter\">Celebrity Twitter</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Hayden Panettiere\">Hayden Panettiere</category>\n <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 08:31:17 +0100</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Brittney Stephens</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">41300151</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Hayden Panettiere Treatment For Postnatal Depression 2016</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>L&#039;Amour!

Over the years, the annual Cannes Film Festival has attracted famous Hollywood couples to the South of France, with stars showing sweet PDA on the red carpet. With this year&#039;s festival underway, we&#039;re spreading the love with a look at past and present twosomes who made the guest list. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/George-Amal-Clooney-Cannes-Film-Festival-2016-41292427&quot; &gt;Amal Clooney stole the Cannes spotlight&lt;/a&gt; in a gorgeous yellow gown when she stepped out with George this week, which was just as cute as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Natalie-Portman-Benjamin-Millepied-Cannes-2015-37476644&quot; &gt;Natalie Portman and her husband&#039;s red carpet outing&lt;/a&gt; last year, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Blake-Lively-Ryan-Reynolds-Captives-Premiere-Cannes-34799683&quot; &gt;Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds&#039;s flawless appearance&lt;/a&gt; in 2014.

To be fair, some of them have been working with each other even before the HBO show. In preparation for the season six premiere, we&#039;ve rounded up a bunch of movies featuring two or more &lt;strong&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/strong&gt; cast members. Some crossovers you probably know about (like &lt;strong&gt;Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens&lt;/strong&gt;), but I can almost guarantee there are a few in here you&#039;ve never heard about.

It was a remarkable and rare show of emotion from the legendarily stoic queen, giving the public a brief glimpse into her private family life with husband Prince Philip. The public tear was also a testament to her love for what became known as the royals&#039; country home at sea.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When Elizabeth and Philip married in 1947, they didn&#039;t move into a new family home. In fact, they&#039;ve never had the opportunity to build and furnish their very own space; over the past almost 70 years, they&#039;ve moved from one inherited home - &lt;i&gt;er&lt;/i&gt;, castle - to another. Yes, it&#039;s nearly impossible to feel sympathy for two royals with multiple estates. But the background of their housing situation proves why it was so meaningful when Elizabeth and Philip had the opportunity to create their first family home, in the form of a yacht, in the early 1950s. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;Image Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gettyimages.com&quot;     rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Getty / Anwar Hussein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth and Philip oversaw the design and decoration of the Britannia when it was agreed that her parents&#039; boat, the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert, was no longer seaworthy. Philip, who has always had a keen interest in design, took over what ended up being a lavish boat with a relatively frugal interior design scheme. Over the years, the royal yacht became scene to family trips with their kids, Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward, as well as a multitude of state functions. Charles and Diana took their honeymoon aboard the yacht, and in time, the queen&#039;s many grandchildren grew to appreciate their own holidays on Britannia. Prince Philip, a former naval man himself, is said to have overseen games, hijinks, and drink parties on the boat&#039;s formidable deck. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;Image Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gettyimages.com&quot;     rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Getty / Anwar Hussein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.royalyachtbritannia.co.uk/&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Royal Yacht Britannia&lt;/a&gt; was decommissioned, the vessel has been moored in Edinburgh, Scotland, where it still sits today as a major tourist attraction in the seaside neighbourhood of &lt;span class=&quot;nobrand&quot;&gt;Leith&lt;/span&gt;. During a recent press tour of the United Kingdom with Visit Britain, POPSUGAR was able to visit the yacht and see the remarkably well-preserved boat. It provided a fascinating look into what life was really like for the queen and her family as they travelled the world in style, racking up a reported one million miles at sea.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;Image Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/images/Allie-Merriam&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;POPSUGAR Photography / Allie Merriam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There were Philip and Elizabeth&#039;s sparse bedrooms, with the single beds they once occupied. (Apparently, it has been the custom for couples of their status and age to always have separate rooms.) Displaying the royals&#039; very relatable frugality, Elizabeth&#039;s bed linens were hand-me-downs. Practically every room has a small bar, where the royals either served themselves or had help to make their favourite drinks, like a gin and Dubonnet for her majesty. There&#039;s also the queen&#039;s office, or sitting room, where she tended to her work and made her way through her &quot;red boxes,&quot; sent by the government and full of official correspondence and updates, daily. All the art is bolted onto the walls, for safety. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;Image Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/images/Allie-Merriam&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;POPSUGAR Photography / Allie Merriam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The largest and grandest room on the ship is the living room, which has an electronic fireplace - naval rules prohibited a real fire - and floral furniture that could be found in any grandparents&#039; sitting room. Remarkably, nothing about Britannia&#039;s interiors seemed overly stuffy or grand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s easy - and great fun - to imagine how the royal family spent their time on Britannia. The queen and her family are known for loving to keep the press at an arm&#039;s length and to retreat as often as possible from the public eye. The royal yacht offered the queen, her husband, and their extended family a chance to literally get away from it all. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the good times came to an end when funding for the yacht was cut by the 1990s Labour government, who were under financial pressure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;small class=&quot;source&quot;&gt;Image Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gettyimages.com&quot;     rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Getty / Max Mumby / Indigo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2011, a number of royals did, however, return to the boat. It was the venue for a prewedding party held the night before the queen&#039;s granddaughter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Zara-Phillips-Wedding-Dress-Pictures-2011-07-30-073142-18511387&quot; &gt;Zara Phillips married rugby player Mike Tindall&lt;/a&gt;. Prince William and his wife of three months at the time, the Duchess of Cambridge, were photographed leaving the event, along with Prices Harry and Edward. One person who did not attend? That would be the queen. Neither she nor Prince Philip has ever been back to Britannia. And given all the good times they&#039;d had on their ship, it&#039;s understandable why the queen had to wipe away that mythical tear.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <comments>http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Visiting-Royal-Yacht-Britannia-Edinburgh-41190027#comment</comments>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/The Royals\">The Royals</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Princess Diana\">Princess Diana</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Prince Philip\">Prince Philip</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Prince William\">Prince William</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Prince Harry\">Prince Harry</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Prince Charles\">Prince Charles</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Queen Elizabeth II\">Queen Elizabeth II</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Kate Middleton\">Kate Middleton</category>\n <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Allie Merriam</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">41190027</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Visiting the Royal Yacht Britannia in Edinburgh</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>Rachel Roy Makes One of Her First Official Appearances Since Beyonc\u00e9 Dropped Lemonade</title>\n <link>http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Rachel-Roy-Charity-Event-LA-May-2016-41290206</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Rachel-Roy-Charity-Event-LA-May-2016-41290206&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;117&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;http://media3.popsugar-assets.com/files/2016/05/12/647/n/1922398/59becbb1_edit_img_cover_file_41288736_1463061992_GettyImages-53o8w7kj.large.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shopstyle.co.uk/browse/rachel-roy?pid=uid921-3589-70&quot; class=&quot;ss_inline_link auto_link_filter no_shopsense_url_rewrite&quot; title=&quot;Shop for Rachel Roy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rachel Roy&lt;/a&gt; is taking a page out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/Beyonce-Knowles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Beyonc\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s book by making lemonade out of lemons.

While she appeared cool and collected as she chatted on her cell phone, she did, in fact, opt to conceal her hair by putting it up in a bun. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The drama first started when she alluded to being &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/Jay-Z&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jay Z&lt;/a&gt;&#039;s other woman in a controversial snap on Instagram.

A day after being presumably executed, Callum Lynch (Michael Fassbender) wakes up to find his whole world flipped upside down when he discovers that he is actually a descendent from a mysterious secret society, the Assassins. As if Fassbender&#039;s hot appearance wasn&#039;t enough to blow your mind, the trailer also features Kanye West&#039;s track &quot;I Am a God.&quot; The movie doesn&#039;t hit theaters until Dec. 30, but you can see the full trailer above as well as the breathtaking poster below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;7&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.4537037037% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFTwePSDGKk/&quot;  style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Assassin&#039;s Creed (@assassinscreedmovie)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2016-05-12T13:22:21+00:00&quot;&gt;May 12, 2016 at 6:22am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</description>\n <comments>http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Assassin-Creed-Trailer-41288619#comment</comments>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Assassin&#039;s Creed\">Assassin&#039;s Creed</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Movies\">Movies</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Movie Trailers\">Movie Trailers</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Michael Fassbender\">Michael Fassbender</category>\n <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:20:00 +0100</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Kelsie Gibson</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">41288619</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Assassin&#039;s Creed Trailer</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>13 Characters Who Are Nearly Identical in DC and the Marvel Cinematic Universes</title>\n <link>http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Marvel-DC-Characters-Similar-41287577</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Marvel-DC-Characters-Similar-41287577&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;112&quot; src=&quot;http://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/2015/11/22/841/n/1922398/22c9dd2f_edit_img_cover_file_39074353_1447383102_bbb99RUa1.large.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only so many ideas in the word - just ask the creators behind these &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Similar-Movies-Came-Out-Same-Time-30573184&quot; &gt;eerily similar movies&lt;/a&gt;. While there are hundreds of bona fide superheroes gracing the pages of comics as well as big and small screens, some of them may strike you as familiar. Why? Well, there are two major comic book companies: Marvel and DC. Each have their own stable of unique heroes and villains, but every so often, they create characters that are shockingly similar. Sure, it might be by accident, but it could also be because the companies have been in constant competition with each other for decades. Now that there are a handful of DC shows on The CW and a bushel of Marvel movies on the big screen (including the newly released &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/tag/Captain-America-Civil-War&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Captain America: Civil War&lt;/a&gt;), it&#039;s a good time to take a look at a few characters who are undeniably identical.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <comments>http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Marvel-DC-Characters-Similar-41287577#comment</comments>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/The Flash\">The Flash</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Arrow\">Arrow</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Marvel\">Marvel</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Movies\">Movies</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/The Avengers\">The Avengers</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/TV\">TV</category>\n <has-gallery></has-gallery>\n <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:00:00 +0100</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Maggie Pehanick</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">41287577</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Marvel and DC Characters That Are Similar</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>Exploring the Theory That the Game of Thrones Book Series Title Gives It All Away</title>\n <link>http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/What-Does-Song-Ice-Fire-Mean-GoT-41287255</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/What-Does-Song-Ice-Fire-Mean-GoT-41287255&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;160&quot; src=&quot;http://media3.popsugar-assets.com/files/2016/05/11/843/n/1922283/e5d594b0_edit_img_image_41250638_1462834967.large.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any devoted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/16-Types-Game-Thrones-Fans-37704205&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game of Thrones fan&lt;/a&gt;, whether they also read the books or are show-only fans, is also up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Game-Thrones-Season-6-Theories-41006260&quot; &gt;the most relevant theories&lt;/a&gt; about the characters. While you might not subscribe to each and every crazy theory out there, it&#039;s got to the point that if you don&#039;t know the most basic theories, you&#039;re way out of the loop. One of these theories is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/How-Game-Thrones-Season-5-Has-Confirmed-Who-Jon-Snow-Real-Parents-37712897&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;R + L = J theory&lt;/a&gt;, which we have explored here before, especially since it looks like this season is setting up the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Jon-Snow-Parents-Game-Thrones-Season-6-41187970&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reveal of Jon Snow&#039;s parents&lt;/a&gt;. That parentage thread, along with the fact that we don&#039;t have all &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/When-Game-Thrones-End-40976624&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;that many Game of Thrones episodes&lt;/a&gt; left after this season, has made us explore one of these big theories. It&#039;s about the end of the series and, essentially, who ultimately wins in the titular game of thrones - so if you don&#039;t want to know, turn back now.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;The Theory: A Song of Ice and Fire Gives the Ending Away&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The title &lt;strong&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/strong&gt; is the name of the TV series but not George R. R. Martin&#039;s book series. The &lt;i&gt;first book&lt;/i&gt; is called &lt;strong&gt;A Game of Thrones&lt;/strong&gt;, but the whole book &lt;i&gt;series&lt;/i&gt;, comprising the already-published five books (and the two still to come), is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/George-Martin-Thrones-Leather-Boxed/dp/B01B3V502M?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;keywords=a%20song%20of%20ice%20and%20fire%20box%20set&amp;amp;qid=1462992343&amp;amp;ref_=sr_1_4&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-4&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/a&gt;. A lovely name, to be sure, but what if it&#039;s more than that?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;What If Ice and Fire Signify Certain People?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What if this epic &quot;song&quot; is about how two characters - symbolised by ice and fire - come together in the end? The obvious characters are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Jon Snow = Ice&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jon has pretty much been living in the icy cold of the Wall and beyond for six seasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Daenerys Targaryen = Fire&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not only has there been tons of fire imagery associated with Daenerys on the show, including her own &quot;rebirth&quot; in the first season in a funeral pyre for Khal Drogo and her dragons breathing fire, but the Targaryen words are also &quot;Fire and Blood.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Therefore, A Song of Ice and Fire = A Song of Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A stretch? Could be, but consider the two characters who fans have an undying love for &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; who both seem destined for something more (Jon&#039;s resurrection being not just a major indication for this but also a distinct parallel to Daenerys&#039;s season-one storyline). Thus, we could be watching the story of how the Seven Kingdoms are destined for two rulers, not just one, and the Iron Throne will be cozily shared by Jon and Daenerys. Also, if the theory that Jon is a Targaryen comes true, you might be pointing out that that makes him and Daenerys related (technically, she&#039;d be his aunt), but marrying within the family has always been a Targaryen custom. (It also seems relevant to point out that the R + L = J theory doesn&#039;t have to be true for this outcome to happen.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And though I suppose other characters could fulfill the ice and fire symbols, it&#039;s almost too obvious. Need more? Also consider those &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ew.com/gallery/game-thrones-new-portraits/616352_kit-harington-and-emilia-clarke&quot;  target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke poses for Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt; that preceded season three (interesting for characters who have never shared a frame on the show) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Game-Thrones-3-Heads-Dragon-Theory-41259640&quot; &gt;three heads of the dragon theory&lt;/a&gt; that is also gaining traction. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this &quot;theory&quot; doesn&#039;t feel so much like a spoiler but the kind of ending that feels right, in a show that often disappoints you with its character deaths and tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <comments>http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/What-Does-Song-Ice-Fire-Mean-GoT-41287255#comment</comments>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Game of Thrones\">Game of Thrones</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/TV\">TV</category>\n <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:40:00 +0100</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Shannon Vestal Robson</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">41287255</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>What Does A Song of Ice and Fire Mean?

Think of it like &lt;strong&gt;Nick &amp;amp; Norah&#039;s Infinite Playlist&lt;/strong&gt; meets &lt;strong&gt;The Game&lt;/strong&gt;: Vee (Roberts) and Ian (Franco) meet during a whirlwind night in New York when Vee is participating in an online game of high-stakes dares. Things start off innocently enough, but soon they get out of hand when the players realise just how manipulative their audience is. The movie is out July 27; check out the trailer and see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Summer-Movies-2016-40837079&quot; &gt;what else is coming out this Summer&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;\n</description>\n <comments>http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Nerve-Movie-Trailer-41273774#comment</comments>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Nerve\">Nerve</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Movies\">Movies</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Movie Trailers\">Movie Trailers</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Dave Franco\">Dave Franco</category>\n <category domain=\"http://www.popsugar.co.uk/latest/Emma Roberts\">Emma Roberts</category>\n <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 10:30:00 +0100</pubDate>\n <dc:creator>Maggie Pehanick</dc:creator>\n <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">41273774</guid>\n <media:rating scheme=\"urn:v-chip\">tv-14</media:rating>\n <search_title>Nerve Movie Trailer</search_title>\n</item>\n<item>\n <title>The Old Gods and the New: Your Guide to Religion on Game of Thrones</title>\n <link>http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Religions-From-Game-Thrones-41270945</link>\n <description>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/Religions-From-Game-Thrones-41270945&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;106&quot; src=&quot;http://media3.popsugar-assets.com/files/2016/04/27/858/n/1922398/ee017b42_edit_img_cover_file_15775818_1461782937_a0dbead106c7e0boLWZZ.large.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;ve found yourself tuning out during the plentiful religious speeches in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/Game-of-Thrones&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/a&gt;, you&#039;re probably kicking yourself for it now - after all, there&#039;s talk of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/3-Theories-About-How-Jon-Snow-Return-Game-Thrones-37738646&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jon Snow being brought back to life&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Game-Thrones-Season-6-Pictures-40153519&quot; &gt;Arya has gone blind&lt;/a&gt; as punishment from some god, and now &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/What-Vaes-Dothrak-Game-Thrones-41073769&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Daenerys might be forced to become the Dothraki version of a nun&lt;/a&gt;.
