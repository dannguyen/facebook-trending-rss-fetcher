Interest rates will also decrease for parents and graduate students, the Treasury announced today.While the change will undoubtedly decrease payments for future borrowers, it's unclear whether the decrease in rates will meaningfully decrease student loan defaults. That's because students who borrow for college but never graduate are three times more likely to default. For most graduates who borrow, repayment of loans is not a significant challenge. The Department of Education acknowledges this problem:For too long, though, America\u2019s higher education system <br><a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/phi-beta-cons/435314/student-loans-interest-rates-decreased\">Read More</a> ...]]></description>\n       \n     \n    <link>https://www.nationalreview.com/phi-beta-cons/435314/student-loans-interest-rates-decreased</link>\n    <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 12:45:18 -0400</pubDate>\n            <dc:creator>Jenna A.
