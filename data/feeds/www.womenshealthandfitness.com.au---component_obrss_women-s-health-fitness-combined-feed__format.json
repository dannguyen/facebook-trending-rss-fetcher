The dermatologist and nutritionist share their expert tips.</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">The experts show us how to optimise your diet for clearer, healthier, brighter skin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/acne\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ACNE</strong></span></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb&nbsp;</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">Dermatologist says: \u201cLook for products that are non-comedogenic, so they do not block pores or cause acne. Key pore-clearing ingredients include salicylic acid (beta hydroxy acids) and many vitamin A products. Also look for anti-inflammatory components such as benzoyl peroxide, zinc and niacinamide. You should look for products that are not too creamy or rich. Even without pore-blocking ingredients, oily or excessively moisturising products will have a detrimental effect on the skin. Go for mineral make-up and combination creams like BB and CC creams.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb&nbsp;</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">Nutritionist says: \u201cConsume a diet low in added sugars and avoid all highly refined, processed foods. Consume three to five cups of bright-coloured vegetables per day and consider supplements such as zinc, vitamin A and vitamin C. There are also natural, DIY methods. Antibacterial tea tree oil and witch hazel are often used on acne-prone skin. Or try combining sea salt and coconut oil and using as a natural exfoliate scrub for congested skin.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/eczema-atopic-dermatitis\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>ECZEMA&nbsp;</strong></span></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb&nbsp;</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">Dermatologist says: \u201cCorticosteroids or calcineurin antagonists may be used to help reduce inflammation and itch. Antihistamines may also help reduce the itch, while antibiotics may be required if infections are severe. Stick to cotton clothing, avoiding wool and synthetics, and you can also use wet dressings to help soothe the skin and reduce itchiness. Cosmetics are best avoided, but if necessary, look for ones that are hypoallergenic. Generally, food avoidance is not useful, but avoiding dairy products, nuts, eggs, chocolate, citrus fruits and wheat products may help.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb&nbsp;</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">Nutritionist says: \u201cImplement an elimination diet to determine possible food triggers, consume an anti-inflammatory, plant-based, whole food diet and consider supplements such as fish oil, vitamin E and probiotics. For eczema, coconut oil may also be of benefit as it\u2019s deeply moisturising and improves skin barrier function. Honey is also great, incorporated into a DIY face mask. It\u2019s antibacterial and a humectant, attracting water to help keep dry skin hydrated.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/cold-sores\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>COLD SORES</strong></span></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb&nbsp;</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">Dermatologist says: \u201cOvertopical astringents and topical Zovirax (acyclovir), cold sores are best treated by oral treatments of anti-virals like acyclovir, valalcyclovir and Famciclovir.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb&nbsp;</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">Nutritionist says: \u201cAddress aggravating factors like food, lifestyle and stress. Avoid chocolate, peanuts and almonds and try to manage stress levels. Start incorporating foods that are high in lysine such as fish, chicken, beef, lamb, cheese, beans, brewer\u2019s yeast and mung bean sprouts and take supplements like lysine, zinc and vitamin C.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><a href=\"https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/psoriasis\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>PSORIASIS&nbsp;</strong></span></a></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb&nbsp;</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">Dermatologist says: \u201cThere is no single treatment that will cure psoriasis. However, it is possible to control it and sometimes clear it. Certain medications can slow down the rate at which the skin cells are produced, but it takes several weeks for your condition to improve. Sunlight helps to clear psoriasis, which is why it usually improves over summer. Remember that psoriatic skin is more easily damaged than normal skin, so you may need to consider skin protection if your job involves hard, manual work.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>\u00bb&nbsp;</strong></span><span class=\"s1\">Nutritionist says: \u201cLook into possible food sensitivities and avoid potential triggers such as alcohol, gluten and dairy. Consume three to five cups of fresh vegetables per day and include turmeric, garlic and ginger. Supplements to take alongside may include fish oil, digestive enzymes, vitamin E and vitamin A.\u201d</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Check out our <a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/health-beauty\" target=\"_blank\">health and beauty </a>section for more tips and tricks.</span></p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/health-beauty/health-advice/2019-your-path-to-healthy-skin\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 00:36:58 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/health-beauty/health-advice/2019-your-path-to-healthy-skin</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Overcoming motivational barriers</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/2018-overcoming-motivational-barriers</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">If you're constantly lack&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation\">motivation</a>, these <a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/1969-motivation-mind-hacks\">psychological tricks</a> might save you a world of grief.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">The stick: </span></strong><span class=\"s1\">Self doubt</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">The fix: </span></strong><span class=\"s1\">Self-inquiry</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Also known as \u2018interrogative self-talk\u2019, self-inquiry promotes acknowledging doubts as part of a process to overcome them. An empowering process, it demands articulating what you\u2019ll do by turning them into questions.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">How it works: Many negative thoughts originate from subconscious beliefs, which affirmations largely choose to ignore. Saying \u2018I can\u2019 and \u2018I will\u2019 works by making you more positive about yourself and your situation, but this has little sway if your fears surface and give you a list of reasons why you \u2018can\u2019t\u2019 or \u2018won\u2019t\u2019. By acknowledging these thoughts and bringing them into your full consciousness you can create congruence between what you\u2019re saying to yourself and what you believe. A study in the journal of Psychological Science found that even something as simple as writing \u2018will I?\u2019 as opposed to \u2018I will\u2019 in an apparently unrelated writing task produced better intentions to exercise.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>The stick:</strong> Doona-itis</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>The fix:</strong> Nudge theory</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Referred to in psych circles as \u2018automaticity\u2019 or goal priming, nudge theory rests on the premise that small changes trick you into achieving substantial goals that can seem overwhelming or impossible. \u201cRather than trying to overtly change people\u2019s behaviour, the idea is to subtly direct people down a particular path by tweaking their environment,\u201d says health psychology researcher Dr Nicola Davies.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">How it works: \u201cThis works by tapping into our two ways of thinking: automatic and reflective,\u201d says Davies. Automatic thoughts are those you fall into habitually and action without much hesitation, like hitting the snooze button, whereas reflective thoughts rely on a conscious effort to do things differently. \u201cNudging is about making the healthier option easier to execute than the less healthy one, so that eventually the new way becomes automatic,\u201d Davies says. A nudge can be \u201canything that influences our choices\u201d. Like laying out your gym clothes the night before, putting your runners by the front door, or putting the vegies on the middle shelf. Priming your goals is about changing your environment so that it not only influences your choices, but also limits them. One Stanford University study found that the more we clutter the mind, the less likely we are to make reflective choices.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Searching for more motivational tactics?

A qualified Pilates and fitness instructor who hates to cook, she fuels her body with organic and wholesome food, and powers her Instagram with poses we can use for good health.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Day on a plate</strong><br />Meal 1: 500 ml water with 2 g chlorella.<br />Meal 2: A long black coffee, two free-range eggs (boiled or scrambled) with one piece of organic rice loaf and one tbsp organic sauerkraut or kimchi.<br />Meal 3: Post-workout shake containing \u00bd frozen banana, handful of fresh or frozen berries, one large dollop of coconut yogurt, \u00bd cup coconut water, one tbsp pea and brown rice protein powder, one tsp superfood powder, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt.<br />Meal 4: Big salad with 100 g tuna or grilled chicken and a homemade dressing containing extra-virgin olive oil and organic/raw/unpasteurised apple cider vinegar.<br />Meal 5: Green vegies with 150 g of a lean protein and \u00bd cup brown rice.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Simmons says</strong><br />I am definitely not a foodie. Frankly, I just don't have time to create mouth-watering masterpieces of 'infused-this' and 'slow-cooked-that'. That doesn't mean to say though that I don't think about what I eat and appreciate food. I limit my alcohol intake and I eat a very healthy, balanced, organic diet that complements my training regime.<br />I would say that my overall diet is high protein, with a balance of good fats and carbohydrates. I always have a protein shake after training, unless I am trying to lean out for a photo shoot. If that's the case, I will avoid all sugar including fruit and limit my liquid intake to just water.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;\">Looking for more motivational stories?

We chat to her about her fit life and food.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>An online fitness coach, bikini competitor and powerlifter, she has transformed her life from skinny, unhappy and unhealthy to strong, confident and full of life \u2013 and now the Sydneysider is on a mission to inspire others.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Day on a plate</strong></p>\r\n<p>Meal 1: Beef rump steak, walnuts, spinach and a side of blueberries.</p>\r\n<p>Meal 2: Turkey breast, macadamias, mushrooms and mixed green vegies.</p>\r\n<p>Meal 3: Barramundi, avocado and mixed green vegies.</p>\r\n<p>Meal 4: Pre-workout meal of chicken breast and white rice.</p>\r\n<p>Meal 5: Post-workout meal of a protein shake with fruit.</p>\r\n<p>Meal 6: Turkey breast and sweet potato.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Simpson says</strong></p>\r\n<p>The body has a greater need for certain nutrients at specific times. Overall, my macros for an entire day of eating are 30 per cent protein, 30 per cent fat and 40 per cent carbs. I always eat my higher carb meals around my workout.</p>\r\n<p>My pre-workout meal consists of a lean protein and a complex carb, eaten 60 to 90 minutes before I hit the gym. I often opt for white rice, as it's easy on the digestive system and is fast acting. I train with quite heavy weights, so having my energy stores full prior to training ensures I maximise my performance.</p>\r\n<p>Immediately after I exercise, I will have a protein shake. Protein consumed within 30 minutes of my workout kick-starts my muscles' recovery process; protein replenishes my muscle glycogen, reduces muscle soreness and fatigue, and promotes muscle repair and growth. I find whey protein isolate is best for fast absorption.</p>\r\n<p>The meal after my post-workout shake is also higher in carbs, with a lean protein. I usually have brown rice in this meal due to its higher fibre content, which leaves me feeling fuller for longer.</p>\r\n<p>Follow Lauren Simpson's journey on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/laurensimpson/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Looking for more motivational stories?

I work out because I know it's good for my body and that's exactly why I chose to pursue a career in healthy living \u2013 I felt like the industry was making it seem like you had to be all or nothing, all the time. I wanted to show women that you can be more casual about fitness, have fun and still see incredible results.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>Her fitness regime</strong></p>\r\n<p>\"I work out no more than four days a week, for about 45 minutes at a time. I do bodyweight exercises focusing on full body movement. I love training my core and getting my heart rate up. I also attend yoga classes as often as possible.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>Her nutrition</strong></p>\r\n<p>\"I absolutely love food and eat an abundance of fresh, natural foods every day. I love acai berry bowls, smoothies and raw chocolate. Sandwiches are also a favourite of mine. I never count calories.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>Behind the scenes</strong></p>\r\n<p>\"When I first got started, I was obsessed with my legs looking a certain way. I have always played sports and so my legs are/were muscular. I didn't understand that you can lose weight, but you can't change your body's natural shape.</p>\r\n<p>\"The one thing I like to make clear through my Instagram is that I cry just like everyone else. The smile you see through my channel is genuine, but I also have my down days \u2013 days where all I want to do is sit on the couch, eat cookies and cry. I think these days are necessary to enjoying the good ones.\"</p>\r\n<p>Looking for more fitness inspiration?

Compare energy density (kJs per 100 g), grams of fat per 100 g (especially saturated) and sugars per 100 g. Keep serving size to half a cup \u2013 not three quarters as some packaging recommends or the two thirds or full cup often suggested for processed cereal products.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Here are a few tips on how to turn your muesli into a healthy breakfast:</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Homemade</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you love muesli, homemade is best. \"Making homemade muesli allows you to have total control over the nutritional content of the finished product,\" Deppeler says. You can add a serving of real fruit, extra protein (think protein powder) and good fats in seeds such as chia.</p>\r\n<p>Tasting Notes: Add \"a variety of grains, such as rolled oats and bran, and a small amount of chopped nuts, seeds and dried fruit\", Deppeler says.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Toasted</strong></p>\r\n<p>The yum factor of toasted muesli puts it on notice for overeating. Which is extra dangerous since toasted varieties are often cooked in fat and cram in significant extra kilojoules with no extra nutrients or satiety.</p>\r\n<p>Tasting Notes: Keep toasted muesli serves to one quarter of a cup, which has about the same number of kilojoules as a half-cup serving of natural muesli.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Garnished</strong></p>\r\n<p>Blinging up muesli with nuts and seeds is a great way to make your brekkie more nutrient dense \u2013 and tasty, Deppeler says. Nuts and seeds are excellent sources of healthy fats and provide an additional source of fibre.</p>\r\n<p>Tasting Notes: Limit portions of nuts and seeds to a pinch as they are energy dense. \"A little goes a long way,\" says Deppeler. But don't eschew them to save kJs; the extra nutrients you gain will help cultivate conditions that result in less hunger later.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Bircher</strong></p>\r\n<p>Muesli soaked in yoghurt or milk has become the brunch du jour, but despite a reputation as a healthy option, so-called bircher can be deceptive. \"Due to the addition of nuts, seeds, dried fruit, fruit juice, yoghurt, sweetener and oil or butter, the kilojoules quickly add up,\" Deppeler cautions. A bowl of bircher can contain as many calories as a plate of fish and chips or slice of lasagne.</p>\r\n<p>Tasting Notes: Caf\u00e9 servings amplify existing energy surpluses as their serving sizes can literally equate to half the average woman's daily energy needs. It's ideal to make your own so you can control additions and quantities, but if you do order out, estimate a half cup and leave the rest.</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/2002-healthy-breakfast-bowl-ideas\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 01:15:46 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/2002-healthy-breakfast-bowl-ideas</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Emma Ascher: March 2016 Bodyblitz winner</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/bodyblitz/monthly-winners/1999-emma-ascher-march-2016-bodyblitz-winner</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">For scuba diving instructor <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/emmaascherfit/\">Emma Ascher</a>, having a healthy mind and body was vital to her everyday self-confidence out on the water. After letting her diet and exercise habits slip and feeling less than comfortable in her denim cut-offs, she rekindled her love of the weights room and is back looking taught, toned and terrific.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Three months ago I was living and working on a tiny island in Thailand, which meant I spent a lot of time in a bikini. I had never been overweight but in the preceding months, I had gotten out of shape and I decided something needed to be done. Around the same time, my friend gave me a copy of WH&amp;F and I read it cover to cover! I was hooked and decided the BodyBlitz challenge was exactly what I was looking for.</p>\r\n<p>After registering, I joined the only gym on the island. It was tiny and dominated by men. I felt really intimidated at first and just bumbled around trying out different machines. But then I did some research and put together some fitness plans with the help of WH&amp;F, bodybuilding.com and YouTube. Within a couple of weeks I felt much more confident and I developed a passion for lifting.</p>\r\n<p>This challenge has given me everything I could have ever wished for. It provided focus and an end date to aim for. I have seen big changes in my body and overhauled my attitude and mindset. My confidence and passion for life has been reignited and I have no intention of stopping my fitness journey anytime soon.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;\">Read on for her thoughts on overcoming challenges, workout motivation, treats and goals.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr class=\"system-pagebreak\" title=\"Emma Ascher - Bodyblitz Winner\" />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><strong><img src=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/images/bodyblitz-marc.jpg\" alt=\"bodyblitz-march - Women's Health and Fitness Magazine\" /></strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><strong>On overcoming challenges:</strong></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"><strong></strong></span>The biggest obstacles I faced were the after-work drinks and the treats my boyfriend would bring home for me. Convincing other people that I was serious about a lifestyle change was the most difficult thing.<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"></span></p>\r\n<p>The first week was the hardest in adapting to the healthy eating and exercise. Getting up early to work out, and eating vegies instead of pizza, is tough to start off with. But after just one week I could see and feel the changes and that spurred me on. After the first month, I was in a groove and it became more of a habit. My body clock adjusted to the early mornings and exercise made me feel accomplished for the rest of the day. My taste buds changed and I craved fruit and vegies instead of processed, high-salt carbs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>On workout motivation:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Exercise was initiated because I wanted to lean down and muscle up, but it goes way deeper than that now. It improves my mood and confidence, which reflects back in my career, relationships and ambitions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>On food swaps:</strong></p>\r\n<p>My attitude to food changed a lot. I now view food as fuel for my body and not just a pleasurable pastime! I still enjoy food but now my body craves clean protein and vegetables.</p>\r\n<p>I moved country right in the middle of my challenge, which meant living with my parents for a few weeks. They were incredibly supportive and my mum had a fridge stocked with fresh foods. After a couple of weeks, they were noticing the weight loss too.</p>\r\n<p><strong>On treats:</strong></p>\r\n<p>I did occasionally indulge myself but I would try and be smart about it. If I knew I was going out for dinner, I would eat really clean for breakfast and lunch so I could enjoy a full meal without feeling too much guilt. I would combine my family events with cheat meals and I would make sure I trained legs the day after to put the extra calories and energy to good use. This prevented me from any guilty feelings the day after that were sure to derail me from my end goal.</p>\r\n<p><strong>On measurements:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The 'before' pictures are a necessary evil. They were depressing to take because I didn't like what I saw but they definitely helped motivate me to change. The 'after' pictures are much more fun and are an even bigger motivation to continue. My after picture will one day be my new before picture!</p>\r\n<p>'Before' and 'after' measurements work the same way. The before measurements can be demoralising, but it's also the first area you see changes. I think documenting pictures and measurements are vitally important to showing progress and maintaining motivation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>On goals:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Having an end goal date really helped me stay on track through the challenge. And knowing that I had submitted those awful 'before' pictures made me determined to see as big of a change as I could manage in the time allowed. I never want to look like that again.</p>\r\n<p>My new goal is to live a happy, full and balanced life. My diet and exercise is always a top priority for me but I realise that sometimes you just have to live. I love my active and clean lifestyle, but if I fancy a drink and dinner with my man, then I'm going to go for it.

Reflect, play, rest, move and mingle to promote brain health.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reflect</strong></p>\r\n<p><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/1907-the-power-of-meditation\">Meditation</a> improves memory, increases brain size, improves cooperation between brain hemispheres and enhances emotional intelligence according to the Exploration of Consciousness Research Institute. A separate study published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience concluded that participating in an eight-week meditation training program was evident in brain function outside of meditation sessions.</p>\r\n<p>TRY IT: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://highperformancecoach.com.au/\">High Performance</a> Coach Stephanie Kakris, who teaches meditation, recommends starting with a guided meditation using an app such as Relax and Rest, which gives five-, 13- or 20-minute options with music or nature sounds.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Play</strong><br />Whether cerebral exercises have any long-term effect on mental performance remains inconclusive, but play has been shown to hone brain processes neglected in routine-driven adult life. \u201cThe main problem is that although people can train themselves to do better on particular tasks, the performance improvement rarely generalises to other tasks and abilities,\u201d says professor Nick Haslam, of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://psych.unimelb.edu.au/\">Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences</a>.</p>\r\n<p>TRY IT: Neuroscientists have designed a series of games called<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.lumosity.com/landing_pages/970?gclid=CIL6jOTl88sCFUhwvAodCqwBnA\"> Lumosity </a>to help challenge certain parts of your brain. The online and smartphone resource let\u2019s you exercise core cognitive abilities whenever and wherever you like.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Nap</strong><br />There\u2019s no greater smart sabotage than undersleeping. Conversely, fixing your sleep habits can give you an instant thinking edge. \u201cBeing well rested means you will use your cognitive skills more efficiently because tiredness, anxiety and stress interfere with mental clarity, focus and concentrated effort,\u201d says Prof Haslam.</p>\r\n<p>TRY IT: Sleeping for as little as an hour less than you need to each night incrementally nets a costly sleep debt according to studies at University of Pennsylvania and the Walter Reed Research Institute. Participants who slept for six hours a night for a fortnight exhibited cognitive parallels to being legally drunk. Aim for eight hours.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Move</strong><br />Vigorous physical exercise has been shown to have long- and short-term brain benefits. Findings published in Behavioural Brain Research suggest certain hormones, which are increased during exercise, may help improve memory and processing speed.</p>\r\n<p>TRY IT: Get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity into most, if not all, days of the week. You can break it into short bouts such as three 10-minute sessions each day.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mingle</strong><br />Networking serves as intensive training in social intelligence. \u201cA big part of success in life is the ability to build strong interpersonal relationships \u2013 be they in a netball team, a family unit or at work,\u201d says Kakris.</p>\r\n<p>TRY IT Mixing with new people, ideas and environments exposes you to new ideas, ways of thinking and perspectives, which can expand the framework within which you think. Face-to-face is ideal, but social media can also serve as a sort of cognitive gym according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.science20.com/profile/andrea_kuszewski\">Florida behaviour therapist Andrea Kuszewski</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Here are 5 other <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/health-beauty/health-advice/919-5-ways-to-keep-your-brain-healthy\">tips to keep your brain healthy</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/health-beauty/health-advice/1986-5-ways-to-promote-a-healthy-brain\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2016 01:15:23 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/health-beauty/health-advice/1986-5-ways-to-promote-a-healthy-brain</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Health and fitness with Lauren Hannaford</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/1979-health-and-fitness-with-lauren-hannaford</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">We chat to Lauren Hannaford (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lozhannaford/\">@lozhannahford</a>) about her top fitness tips, how she stays motivated and her fitness mantra.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After competing as an elite gymnast for more than 20 years, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.isowhey.com.au/\">IsoWhey</a>-sponsored athlete Lauren \u2018Loz\u2019 Hannaford turned her fitness sights to gymnastics coaching, modelling and personal training. While touring the world with The Wiggles (yep, she once performed on stage as Dorothy the Dinosaur), Hannaford learnt the importance of the \u2018do anywhere, anytime\u2019 workout for boosting her health and wellbeing. \u201cI always remind myself of how much more energised and vibrant I feel all day after I sweat myself through an awesome workout.\u201d</p>\r\n<p><strong>Her top tips</strong><br />Write it down - \u201cThis is a great way to believe you can do it. There is something about writing it down that makes it become real. When it becomes a real commitment there is no room for self-doubt or sabotage.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>Focus on process, not outcome - \u201cI encourage [my clients] to have their specific goals but to ultimately make their main goal about a continued lifestyle. If you work toward the goal of making it become an ongoing lifestyle then you will just watch the other goals and results roll in naturally.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>Patience - \u201cYou see so many people fall off the wagon because their goal is too out of reach for the time being or don\u2019t allow enough time. People often set goals and then can\u2019t understand why they haven\u2019t reached them after their first workout. Olympic athletes weren\u2019t built in a day.\u201d</p>\r\n<p><strong>Motivation hacks</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>Cultivate enjoyment - \u201cThink about how you feel after each workout; how those feelgood endorphins make you feel vibrant and energised. I\u2019ve never met a person who was disappointed they got up and did a workout but I have met plenty who were disappointed when they didn\u2019t, and that is the motivation I get clients to use to keep coming back, not just focus on a weight loss number or whatever it may be.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>Mantra magic - \u201cHave positive mantras that you memorise and remind yourself of over and over again. One that gets you to your workout, one that gets you through your workout and one that reminds you of how good you feel for doing your workout \u2013 so there is no room for negative thoughts.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>Go team - \u201cRally your friends or a work team around you. Train together and make it a ritual so that you are training for you but you are also all there training for each other. Coffee dates become a ritual, right? Then why not make training part of the ritual \u2013 before the coffee?\u201d</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fit focus for 2016</strong><br />\u201cI think one of my focuses for my fitness in 2016 is to be more conscious of not letting winter stop me. I normally do my own kind of training but definitely next winter I will be booking into more classes to get my butt committed to training no matter how much I love my doona and pillow. And I\u2019ll be changing things up and giving something new a try.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/1979-health-and-fitness-with-lauren-hannaford\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2016 04:46:25 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/1979-health-and-fitness-with-lauren-hannaford</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>#RawFitspo - Win 1 of 3 protein packs from Amazonia</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/competitions/1978-rawfitspo-win-1-of-3-protein-packs-from-amazonia</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">WIN 1 of 3 AMAZONIA Protein Packs to fuel your workouts, by sharing your #RawFitspo selfie.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>How to win<br /></strong></span></p>\r\n<p>Stay tuned for callouts on our official <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/womenshealthandfitness/?ref=bookmarks\">Facebook page</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/whandfmag/\">Instagram </a>every month.

A personal trainer and women\u2019s wellness coach who lives by her own advice, Brittney Cutts told WH&amp;F about her mission to help the world B.Active.</p>\r\n<p><strong>About the brand</strong></p>\r\n<p>My brand B.Active is all about helping women achieve their health and fitness goals through my own experiences and education. I post on Instagram about my life and things I\u2019ve learnt. I want to encourage people to make healthier choices every day and to lead a lifestyle they can maintain; to \u2018B.Active\u2019, \u2018B.Nourished\u2019 and \u2018B.Happy\u2019. &nbsp;<br />When I was growing up I used to get teased for having \u2018chicken legs\u2019 and for being too skinny. I used to eat a McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger a day to try and beef myself up, which shows how oblivious I was to health and nutrition. I want to help other young women avoid those kinds of mistakes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What she eats</strong></p>\r\n<p>My average diet is full of food! I absolutely love it. I try to be as healthy as possible most of the time, but I\u2019m not afraid of a glass of wine either. I am a much happier person when I have balance. If I want to lose a little body fat, I will base my meals around meats, vegetables and good fats like avocado, walnuts and salmon. I supplement with iron, a probiotic and Trilogy greens.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Her workout plan</strong></p>\r\n<p>My favourite form of exercise is boxing. It is a good form of cardio and makes me feel like a bit of a badass. It\u2019s a great stress reliever too.<br />Exercise and nutrition are important to me because they\u2019re natural antidepressants. I think it\u2019s intriguing how we can sculpt how our body looks on the outside while also achieving a sense of wellness on the inside. My body looks and feels horrible when I eat junk or under-train. <br />I overcome my cravings by removing foods that lack nutritional value from my shopping list. I find it hard to stay away from the Nutella jar sometimes, but if I don\u2019t buy it then I can\u2019t eat it!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Thoughts on staying motivated</strong></p>\r\n<p>I keep motivated by changing my phone\u2019s background picture to reflect my next goal, so it\u2019s always in my mind\u2019s eye! There is a real sense of accomplishment when I work hard to achieve that goal and can change the photo.<br />I take time out to relax by going on spontaneous adventures. I leave my phone behind and get out of the city. Or I book a last-minute holiday to somewhere warm and with a beach, like Bali. I love random getaways and activities to break up my routine.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Getting social</strong></p>\r\n<p>I have built my social media following <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brittactive/?hl=en\">@brittactive</a> by being real. I am not a model and I don\u2019t over-promote or worry too much about how many followers I have. I just post about my life and continuously think about how each post might help other women in some small way.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Wise words of advice</strong></p>\r\n<p>The best advice I\u2019ve ever received was to build a career that you love. There is no point spending 80 per cent of your day unhappy. <br />I admire people who live their life the way they really want to. They are the happiest ones, I think. It shouldn\u2019t matter how much money, friends or followers someone has, everyone is different. If they are happy, so be it!</p>\r\n<p><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\" />Looking for more Insta fitspo?

I train right before lunch, so it\u2019s usually eggs. For post-workout I will normally get a banana in right away with glutamine and then head to the local market for greens and another protein such as a chicken breast.</p>\r\n<p>ON HEALTHY TREATS<br />I have a great recipe for sweet potato brownies. I find so many recipes use dates, of which I am not the biggest fan, so I switched them for these.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What you'll need:</strong><br />\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2 cups baked sweet potato (skin removed)<br />\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3 eggs<br />\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00bc cup coconut oil (melted)<br />\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00bc cup agave<br />\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00bc tsp vanilla<br />\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3 tbsp coconut flour<br />\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4 tbsp cocoa powder<br />\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2 tsp cinnamon<br />\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00bd tsp fresh ground ginger<br />\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00bc tsp pumpkin pie spice<br />\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\u00bc tsp baking powder<br />\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pinch sea salt<br />\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Chocolate chunks (as many as you\u2019d like)</p>\r\n<p><strong>What you'll do</strong> <br />Heat oven to 220\u00b0C. In a blender, add potato, egg, oil, agave, vanilla and blend until smooth. Add coconut flour, cocoa, cinnamon, ginger, spice, baking powder and salt and blend again. Fold the chocolate in by hand. Bake in a 20x20 cm dish for 35 minutes. Let sit for 30 minutes before serving.</p>\r\n<p><span itemprop=\"articleBody\"><strong>You might also like </strong>browsing more <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/recipe-finder\">healthy recipes</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/1972-sweet-potato-brownies\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2016 22:32:22 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/1972-sweet-potato-brownies</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Chocolate banana pancake recipe</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/1971-chocolate-banana-pancake-recipe</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">Get your essential aminos on with these protein-packed brunch or post-workout meal.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What you'll need (makes 10 pikelet-size pancakes)</strong><br />Pancakes</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1 cup egg whites</li>\r\n<li>\u00bd cup vanilla whey protein powder</li>\r\n<li>2 tbsp cottage cheese (if desired)</li>\r\n<li>\u00bc cup buckwheat flakes or rolled oats</li>\r\n<li>2 tbsp coconut flour</li>\r\n<li>1 tsp baking powder</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Topping (optional)</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1 tbsp chocolate protein powder</li>\r\n<li>Water or almond milk to mix</li>\r\n<li>Sliced banana (berries may be substituted)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>What you'll do</strong> <br />Heat non-stick pan with spray oil.

For example, prospection \u2013 imagining how you\u2019ll feel when what is now the future becomes the past \u2013 is just one hack. Along with these, strategic conversations with yourself and distraction can also work.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Take your mind elsewhere</strong><br />If workouts feel like torture, no amount of refraining is going to work as you\u2019re creating fresh evidence for the argument that exercise sucks. Try listening to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/fitness/workouts/437-whats-your-workout-playlist\">music</a>. Research shows that listening to music during a workout can extend the duration before you get tired, you\u2019re effectively buying extra time and assisting your mission to re-imagine exercise as somewhere between neutral and enjoyable.</p>\r\n<p>The diversion lowers perception of effort while endorphins released in response to hearing music we like masks fatigue according to psychologist Dane Barclay from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pspc.com.au/\">Victoria\u2019s Performance and Sports Psychology Clinic</a>. \u201cWhen we recognise that we are not enjoying something, our mind sends a spike of stress hormone cortisol to engage us in a behaviour that removes distress,\u201d he says. Yet playlist selection is key as music that doesn\u2019t match the workout tempo (think beats per minute) can backfire, piquing the body\u2019s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/fitness/25-popular-topics/1953-good-pain-vs-bad-pain\">pain </a>response.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Think of the outcome</strong></p>\r\n<p>Before you reach over for one too many doughnuts, a wave of guilt suddenly washes over you as you think of the outcomes of eating that extra doughnut. This here, is called prospection. It\u2019s the ability to anticipate future mental processes, motivational and emotional states according to a paper published in the Journal Frontiers in Neuroscience. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Staying home and telling the girls you have a migraine, for instance, is likely to leave you feeling lousier than you possibly could from any half-hour workout. Conversely, you probably know well that there\u2019s nothing more empowering than conquering a challenge, so you can be pretty sure that even if the workout does suck (and it\u2019s unlikely), the feeling afterwards will be worth it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self-talk is real talk</strong></p>\r\n<p>Despite the appeal of memes and affirmations, statements of effervescent positivity can work against achieving goals. The problem, experts say, is that layering a conscious thought over contrary unconscious core beliefs can lead to counterproductive inner conflict (think analysis paralysis) and self-flagellation when results fail to materialise.</p>\r\n<p>A study published in journal Psychological Science suggests that rather than steamrolling doubts and telling yourself you\u2019re sure you\u2019ll run faster today than ever, also known as \u2018declarative self-talk\u2019, acknowledge your fear that you\u2019ll barely make the 1km mark and come up with a question that challenges you to refute your contention (known as \u2018interrogative self-talk). \u2018Will I run my fastest time?\u2019 \u2018Last summer I struggled in the heat, but training in the heat will help me to run better times in hot conditions.\u2019</p>\r\n<p>The trick is to acknowledge doubts and incorporate them into your answer; while \u2018hell, yes\u2019 might get you out the door, if it\u2019s unrealistic, you\u2019re destined to fail and failure will only disempower you by solidifying doubt.</p>\r\n<p><strong>You might also like </strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation\">motivation tips from our trainers and experts.</a></p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/1969-motivation-mind-hacks\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2016 00:14:05 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/1969-motivation-mind-hacks</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Getting to know Tasha Ross</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/1959-getting-to-know-tasha-ross</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">We chat to Tasha Ross <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tasha_rossxx/?hl=en\">@tasha_rossxx</a> about her career and journey in fitness.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Tasha Ross was modelling internationally when she looked around and saw nothing but thin girls with poor habits. Determined to pursue a career without damaging her health, she returned to Australia, completed a personal training course and shed 10 kg of fat. The rest is history (or can be found via social media.)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Her career</strong><br />\u201cI wanted to show others that starving yourself isn\u2019t healthy, eating is. I began training children at sport clinics and I noticed they were often unaware of the harmful foods they were eating and the impact it had on their health. I believe more time and money needs to be put into diet and exercise education.\u201d</p>\r\n<p><strong>Her fitness regime</strong><br />\u201cI do a mix of Pilates, cardio and weight lifting about five times a week. I believe the more well rounded your exercise routine is, the better your results will be. Rest days are also really important.<br />\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of booty building and creating curves. Deadlifts and lunges I find so challenging but they make such a difference to your shape.\u201d</p>\r\n<p><strong>Her nutrition</strong><br />\u201cI found I was intolerant to dairy, gluten, wheat, and almonds, limiting my food options. My diet is usually shaped like an upside-down triangle, eating a big breakfast and having smaller and smaller meals as the day goes on. I eat around five-to-six meals a day to keep my metabolism up.\u201d</p>\r\n<p><strong>Behind the scenes</strong><br />\u201cWhen I was younger I had scoliosis (a curvature in the spine), which prevented me from doing several exercises I loved. Everyone has their weaknesses but you just have to work around them. I have done Pilates for a few years now and it\u2019s really helped manage the issue. It\u2019s a great form of rehabilitation.\u201d</p>\r\n<p><br data-mce-bogus=\"1\" />For more real life stories and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation\">motivation</a>, check out our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle\">lifestyle section</a>. </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/1959-getting-to-know-tasha-ross\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2016 20:40:08 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/1959-getting-to-know-tasha-ross</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>The sisters behind Base Body Babes</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/1958-the-sisters-behind-base-body-babes</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">We chat to the sisters behind the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/basebodybabes/\">@basebodybabes</a> to find out what their life in fitness involves.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For anyone who grew up with a mad love for their soul sister, or who wouldn\u2019t be seen dead in the gym without their fit buddy, this dynamic duo is for you. Personal trainers and experts in post-pregnancy fat loss, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/basebodybabes/\">basebodybabes</a> love spoiling us with athletic snaps almost too cute to handle. The happy pair offer a range of online personal training systems for women, run their own successful business in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.australianstrengthcoach.com/\">Base Gym</a> and top it off with health food caf\u00e9 Base Fuel, brimming with raw, sugar-free deserts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Our career</strong></p>\r\n<p>\u201cOnce we started training and helping others, everything shifted for us and we knew this was what we wanted to do. As sisters, the fact that we could do it together was even better. We felt like we had a lot to offer our clients and women in general \u2013 it\u2019s a really great feeling helping them achieve their goals and change their lives.&nbsp; It was a no brainer for us, we just had to make a career out of it.\u201d</p>\r\n<p><strong>Our fitness regime</strong><br />\u201cWeights, weights and more weights! We lift between three-to-six times per week and we love it! Our system is based on a combination of strength and circuit-style training.\u201d</p>\r\n<p><strong>My nutrition</strong><br />\u201cWe love to eat fresh, natural wholefoods. We have a portion of protein with every meal, with lots of vegies and some fruit. We drink loads of water throughout the day and we try not to buy too many processed or packaged foods.\u201d</p>\r\n<p><strong>Behind the scenes</strong><br />\u201cWe tend to store fat in the lower part of our bodies, which is common for women. When we were younger, we weren\u2019t so great at appreciating our natural body shape. As we grew up, and became more educated and experienced in life, we began to realise that we are all different as humans and we should embrace our natural curves. We have booties, so rather than trying to change that, we work it!\u201d</p>\r\n<p><strong>NEXT:</strong> Find more motivational tips from the experts <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/1958-the-sisters-behind-base-body-babes\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2016 03:34:48 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/lifestyle/motivation/1958-the-sisters-behind-base-body-babes</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Top fat loss tips</title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/weight-loss/fat-loss/1957-top-fat-loss-tips</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">From <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/fitness/workouts/435-the-importance-of-active-recovery\">recovery</a> sessions to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/healthy-eating/548-is-gluten-free-better\">food intolerances</a>, trainer and IsoWhey sports ambassador <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://alexatowersey.com/\">Alexa Towersey </a>shares her top five tips for fat loss.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Complete a lifestyle diary</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>This includes what you eat, when you go to bed, how often you go to the bathroom and how much water you drink. This will make you accountable and aware of any bad habits outside of the gym that could be hindering your results. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Schedule at least two recovery sessions per week</strong></p>\r\n<p>I liken your body to a bank balance.&nbsp; Every training session is a withdrawal; every recovery session is a deposit. If you are always training (withdrawing) and never recovering (depositing), you will eventually end up overdrawn and injured. Recovery practices include foam rolling, contrast showers, ice baths, massages and long walks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Embrace <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/fitness/workouts/1394-hot-yoga-vs-bikram-whats-the-difference\">hot yoga</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>The hot room allows for increased range of movement (which will translate into better range in your weight training), the heat enhances detoxification processes and the twisting movements improve digestion and lymphatic drainage in addition to massaging the internal organs.&nbsp; Yoga is also great for stress management, and when you are stressed you will hold fat.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Test for food intolerances</strong></p>\r\n<p>Just because a food is \u2018healthy\u2019, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s healthy for you. If it doesn\u2019t make you feel good, don\u2019t eat it. Some of the most common intolerances include eggs, gluten, wheat, dairy, soy, corn and nuts. Intolerances can also be a result of eating too much of the same foods, so try and rotate your meal options regularly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Support your liver and your <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/3-diet-plans/1887-7-step-detox-plan\">detoxification </a>channels using alternative body treatments</strong></p>\r\n<p>Think acupuncture, lymphatic drainage massage, Epsom salt baths, body brushing and infra-red saunas. Drink plenty of water to flush out toxins and try starting the day with a glass of warm water with fresh lemon juice.</p>\r\n<p>For more fat loss tips, visit our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/weight-loss/fat-loss\">weight loss</a> section.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{nomultithumb}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a href=\"http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/weight-loss/fat-loss/1957-top-fat-loss-tips\" target=\"_blank\">Read more ...</a>]]></description>\n\t\t\t<dc:creator>Administrator</dc:creator>\n\t\t\t<pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2016 02:48:23 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/weight-loss/fat-loss/1957-top-fat-loss-tips</guid>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t\t<title>Cinnamon Proughnuts </title>\n\t\t\t<link>http://www.womenshealthandfitness.com.au/diet-nutrition/recipe-finder/1956-cinnamon-proughnuts</link>\n\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"intro\">For a sweet treat minus the guilt, try these cinnamon proughnuts.
