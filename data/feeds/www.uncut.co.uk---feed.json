According to one observer, he &#8220;sometimes throws his advisers into a frenzy of hair-tearing despair: moody, unpredictable, perverse, often downright wilful \u2014 but always creative.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These words bear the weight of long experience. They were, however, written in 1966, for the sleevenotes of &#8220;Them Again&#8221;, only the second album that Morrison was involved with. The youthful singer hadn&#8217;t even stepped out of the garage band ranks, hadn&#8217;t endured the harrowing business tussles that would mark the start of his solo career. Already, though, an indelible image was in place: the furious, inscrutable auteur, raging at industry machinations that conspired to sully the purity of his art.</p>\n<p>It would have been impossible to compile our Ultimate Music Guide on Van Morrison &#8211; out in the UK on Thursday, though you can <a href=\"http://bit.ly/VanUMG\">buy it from our online shop right now</a>, along with the latest volume of our History Of Rock project &#8211; without reflecting this part of his story. Substantial chunks of his later albums, after all, revolve around such complaints, and virtually every one of his rare interviews end up tackling the subject. &#8220;I don&#8217;t really suit the music business,&#8221; he tells Uncut&#8217;s Jon Wilde in a revelatory 2005 piece. &#8220;Or, indeed, any business. I&#8217;m incompatible with the way things are done&#8230; It&#8217;s not easy doing what I do. It&#8217;s not easy being able to fight the fight with these people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>To most fans, however, Morrison appears to have fought the music business with uncommon skill, tenacity and, ultimately, success. In this latest Uncut Ultimate Music Guide, serendipitously timed to coincide with a radically expanded <a href=\"http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/van-morrison-revisits-1973-tour-new-archive-set-74080\">reissue of his classic &#8220;It&#8217;s Too Late To Stop Now&#8221; live set</a>, new reviews of his back catalogue track the progress of a rogue spirit, chasing his muse across musical genres and spiritual codes, always privileging the spontaneous and unfettered. Compromises are, to put it mildly, thin on the ground. Epiphanies are commonplace: from the canonical high of Astral Weeks, through fervid sessions in Woodstock and California, on to the mystical quests of the &#8217;80s and beyond, into less feted but equally rewarding territory.</p>\n<p>In a 1983 NME piece reprinted in the edition, Gavin Martin recalls meeting Morrison in the company of Kevin Rowland. &#8220;Unaware of my own occupation,&#8221; Martin writes,&#8221;[Morrison] dismissed the music press, resenting all the dumb egotistical hacks, and said he only gave interviews if he held the copyright. In America, he continued, they\u2019d brought out books with old interviews in them and what he said then no longer applied to what he was doing. Plus, they were making mileage out of his name, his past, and it was a game he\u2019d stopped playing a long time ago.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One can only speculate, fearfully, about what the man himself would make of all our passionate analysis, our revisiting his past showdowns with the writers of NME, Melody Maker and Uncut. Nevertheless, what emerges is a consistent portrait of a man apart, unstinting of vision, blessed with a voice like no other.

Here, Basildon\u2019s kings of electro-sleaze seem reinvigorated as they discuss 30 years of highs, lows and landmark LPs, and look forward to the release of a new one. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to be in this band,\u2019\u201d they tell us\u2026 Interview: Stephen Dalton. Originally published in Uncut&#8217;s May 2009 issue (Take 144).</strong></p>\n<p>________________________</p>\n<p><strong>SPEAK &amp; SPELL</strong><br />\n<strong> MUTE, 1981</strong><br />\n<strong> Produced by Mute label boss Miller, the band\u2019s debut was clean, chart-friendly synth-pop. And largely written by Vince Clarke, who left to form Yazoo soon afterwards.<br />\n</strong></p>\n<figure class=\"o-container youtube\"><iframe width=\"630\" height=\"354\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/OrlkzAXD5MY?feature=oembed&#038;fs=0&#038;modestbranding=1&#038;theme=light&#038;showinfo=1&#038;autohide=0&#038;rel=0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>\n<p>MARTIN GORE, guitar, keyboards: It\u2019s a different band, literally. Vince was at the helm and he wrote nearly all the songs. It sounds totally different to anything else we\u2019ve done. Even the next album, A Broken Frame [1982], was a slight departure, though it still had its roots in bubblegum.<br />\nANDY FLETCHER, keyboards: Vince was definitely still in charge at that time. I still have fond memories of being in the studio for the first time, being young and very na\u00efve but luckily having Daniel to help us get through it. We were a boy band, basically. We were kids. But we were never groomed like these kids today. We didn\u2019t go to stage school, we didn\u2019t learn to dance from the age of two.<br />\nGORE: Vince told us before the actual release date that he was leaving. We never thought about stopping. It\u2019s one of the luxuries of youth that you don\u2019t worry too much about those things.<br />\nFLETCHER: When we started our accountant did a tax plan for us to last three years, and we\u2019ve done that by 10 times now. But he was only going by what happens to most groups.<br />\nDAVE GAHAN, vocals: Speak &amp; Spell is a solid album, whether you like it or not. I still think of it as Vince\u2019s album \u2013 and all the records he\u2019s made since sound exactly the same.

His latest film, <strong>Everybody Wants Some!!</strong>, is a warm, meandering tale set just before the first day of term in a Texas university in 1980. The similarities are entirely intentional: Linklater has described his new film as a \u2018spiritual sequel\u2019 to his earlier piece. Accordingly, this is an agreeably shaggy yarn about the thoughts and desires of an amiable bunch of characters, set on the cusp of adulthood. Maybe Linklater should have called his film <strong>Dudehood</strong>?</p>\n<p>The film\u2019s protagonists are a group of college baseball players who share a house off-campus together. Bongs are smoked, rock music is played at volume, mattresses are used to surf downstairs. 1980 is a propitious date: it falls roughly halfway between the releases of <strong>Animal House</strong> and <strong>Porky\u2019s</strong>, both films you\u2019d imagine the characters in Everybody Wants Some!! would have enjoyed immensely.</p>\n<figure class=\"o-container youtube\"><iframe width=\"630\" height=\"354\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/y6raUs0CiCQ?feature=oembed&#038;fs=0&#038;modestbranding=1&#038;theme=light&#038;showinfo=1&#038;autohide=0&#038;rel=0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>\n<p>Jake (<strong>Blake Jenner</strong>), is a talented pitcher beginning his freshman year at a Texas university. He finds himself bunked in with fellow teammates, whose pursuit of beer, sex and Good Times is paramount. \u201cThis is the best day of my life \u2013 until tomorrow!\u201d says one. Linklater is generous with his cast. Even in this busy ensemble, everyone gets their chance to shine. There is Finnegan (<strong>Glen Powell</strong>), the talkative king of campus; competitive star player Glen (<strong>Tyler Hoechlin</strong>); stoner Willoughby (<strong>Wyatt Russell</strong>). An early scene established the key characters via a car singalong to Sugar Hill Gang&#8217;s &#8220;<strong>Rapper&#8217;s Delight</strong>&#8220;, a moment to rival the similar &#8220;<strong>Bohemian Rhapsody</strong>&#8221; scene in Wayne&#8217;s World.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, there is no antagonist \u2013 no <strong>Dean Wormer</strong>, if you like \u2013 on their tails, threatening to disrupt their fun. Does the film need some kind of dramatic threat? Evidently, Linklater thinks not. As they hustle their way round discos, house parties, student dorms and sports halls &#8211; their exploits soundtracked by Van Halen, The Knack, Cheap Trick, Blondie and The Cars and more &#8211; Linklater seems content to simply let his dudes be. Why spoil the fun?</p>\n<p>Everybody Wants Some!! is indisputably a male film \u2013 there is only one female character of note. But the jocks in Linklater\u2019s film are miles apart from today\u2019s frat movie characters; these are mostly clever, curious and likeable, their camaraderie given a tender spin by Linklater.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelbonner\">@MichaelBonner</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.uncut.co.uk/publication/uncut/june-2016\">The June 2016 issue of Uncut is now on sale in the UK \u2013 featuring our cover story on Blondie, plus George Martin, Brian Eno, Dexys, The Monkees, Graham Nash, Merle Haggard, Ronnie Spector, Tony Joe White, Frank Zappa, Eric Clapton, The Coral, Max Richter and more plus 40 pages of reviews and our free 15-track CD</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Uncut: the spiritual home of great rock music.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.uncut.co.uk/blog/reviewed-richard-linklaters-everybody-wants-74068\">Reviewed!

The whole video was conceived, designed, built and animated in 14 days, we finished last Thursday. I am immensely proud of everyone that worked their asses off on it &#8211; for many of them it was their first film. I shall introduce them in later posts&#8230; But for now thank you!
