Not under threat of law, but threat of cut funding. The <em>New York Times</em> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/13/us/politics/obama-administration-to-issue-decree-on-transgender-access-to-school-restrooms.html?smid=tw-bna\" target=\"_blank\">reports tonight</a> that the President will issue a &#8220;decree&#8221; ordering all public schools in the country to allow &#8220;transgender students&#8221; to use the bathroom and locker room of their choice.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The letter to school districts that will go out Friday describing what they should do to ensure that none of their students are discriminated against, signed by officials of the Justice Department and Department of Education, does not have the force of law. But it contains an implicit threat: Schools that do not abide by the Obama administration\u2019s interpretation of the law could face lawsuits or a loss of federal aid.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s right, the threat is that the President will put at risk the quality of education for students in school districts that do not comply with his whims. The <em>Times</em> predicts that &#8220;Republicans&#8221; may object that &#8220;the federal government is wading into local matters and imposing its own values on communities across the country.&#8221; Gee, ya think?</p>\n<p>The Times has copy of the letter from which they pull this excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cA school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so,\u201d according to the letter, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So they cannot be required to use the bathroom of their genetic, physical gender, and moreover, cannot be required to use private or individual bathrooms which would avoid everyone&#8217;s discomfort. The decree is that if you&#8217;re a 12 year old girl, there may be a penis next to you in the bathroom. But don&#8217;t you dare complain.</p>\n<p>Seriously, don&#8217;t bother to complain. The letter says your concerns don&#8217;t matter one bit. That&#8217;s not my interpretation, it literally says that. It states that schools are required to comply &#8220;even in circumstances in which other students, parents, or community members raise objections or concerns.&#8221; So, you know, tough luck.</p>\n<p>How is all of this sorted out?</p>\n<blockquote><p>As soon as a child\u2019s parent or legal guardian asserts a gender identity for the student that \u201cdiffers from previous representations or records,\u201d the letter says, the child is to be treated accordingly \u2014 without any requirement for a medical diagnosis or birth certificate to be produced. It says that schools may \u2014 but are not required to \u2014 provide other restroom and locker room options to students who seek \u201cadditional privacy\u201d for whatever reason.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Your concerns matter so little that the school is not even required to allow you a private option. As is the case with Target &#8211; and pretty much with every liberal idea under every possible circumstance in any location anywhere &#8211; the will, the privacy, the comfort, the concerns, and even the safety of the vast and overwhelming majority is of literally no consequence in the face of a supposedly aggrieved identity group.</p>\n<p>This is bald abuse of power. Naked bullying, literally. But it doesn&#8217;t matter. What you think doesn&#8217;t matter. Not to the left, and not to President Obama.</p>\n<p>It never has.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com/absentee/2016/05/12/wrong-side-history-class-obama-issue-pubic-school-transgender-decree/\">[BREAKING] Wrong Side of History Class: Obama To Issue Public School Transgender Decree TOMORROW</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com\">RedState</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.redstate.com/absentee/2016/05/12/wrong-side-history-class-obama-issue-pubic-school-transgender-decree/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>2</slash:comments>\n\t<enclosure url=\"http://www.redstate.com/uploads/2016/05/ObamaBathroom-300x170.jpg\" length=\"20474\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Activism Training Coming to the RedState Gathering</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.redstate.com/bryanpruitt/2016/05/12/activism-training-coming-redstate-gathering/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.redstate.com/bryanpruitt/2016/05/12/activism-training-coming-redstate-gathering/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2016 02:00:32 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"/bryanpruitt/\">Bryan Pruitt</a> (<a href=\"/diary/bryanpruitt/\">Diary</a>)]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Front Page Stories]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.redstate.com/?p=294971</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Sure, you read RedState every day, follow the political arena locally and nationally, and maybe go to a community meeting every once in a while.

Trey Gowdy, would like to talk with the anonymous source and are taking actions to find out who he is.</p>\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/select-committee-on-benghazi-hunts-for-air-force-whistleblower/article/2591208\">Washington Examiner</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cRep.

Gen. Scott Zobrist, who stated:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;\u2026the probability of success would be so low and the risk would be so high&#8221; that he did not believe sending jets to Benghazi from the Aviano Air Base in Italy would have made a difference in the outcome of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, for the Democrats, \u201cprobably\u201d is enough.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cMatt Wolking, a spokesman for the panel&#8217;s Republicans, noted that &#8220;unlike the Democrats,&#8221; the majority has no &#8220;predetermined conclusions&#8221; about the Air Force whistleblower.</p>\n<p>\u2018Democrats may wish to dismiss or ignore some witnesses without talking to them, but that&#8217;s not how thorough, fact-centered investigations are done,\u2019 Wolking told the\u00a0<em>Washington Examiner</em>.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is speculation that the anonymous source is a Facebook poster who claimed to be a mechanic with Aviano Air Base at the time of the attacks, and who maintains the aircraft at the base could have reached Benghazi that night.</p>\n<p>The Pentagon and Defense Department have so far scoffed at the idea of interviewing those who are seen as \u201clow level\u201d witnesses, and have drug their heels in cooperating with the select committee.</p>\n<p>Gowdy has expressed a different opinion.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;\u2019It is exactly this type of interview that has, to date, yielded results and uncovered new facts unavailable to more senior military commanders,\u2019 the South Carolina Republican\u00a0<a href=\"http://benghazi.house.gov/sites/republicans.benghazi.house.gov/files/documents/5.6.16%20TG%20letter%20to%20SecDef%20Carter.pdf\">wrote in a letter</a>\u00a0to Defense Secretary Ash Carter on May 6.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>It has been almost four years since the attack in Benghazi, and thus far, there has been only one arrest, and few answers for the families of Glen Doherty, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com/sweetie15/2016/05/12/house-select-committee-benghazi-want-interview-anonymous-whistleblower/\">House Select Committee on Benghazi Want to Interview Anonymous Whistleblower</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com\">RedState</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.redstate.com/sweetie15/2016/05/12/house-select-committee-benghazi-want-interview-anonymous-whistleblower/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>RACIST MURDER FANTASY: The Butler Did It, But Team Trump Lied About It</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.redstate.com/absentee/2016/05/12/racist-murder-fantasy-butler-team-trump-lied/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.redstate.com/absentee/2016/05/12/racist-murder-fantasy-butler-team-trump-lied/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 23:30:33 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"/absentee/\">Caleb Howe</a> (<a href=\"/diary/absentee/\">Diary</a>)]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Breaking]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Campaigns]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured Story]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Front Page Stories]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Butler]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.redstate.com/?p=295012</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump&#8217;s butler has been in the news today, which is a hilarious thing to type.

They have attempted, via executive action, to grant amnesty to massive numbers of illegal immigrants who are currently in the country. But also, they have been by all accounts more aggressive in actually deporting illegal immigrants than the Bush administration who preceded them.</p>\n<p>Via the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/12/us-immigration-officials-deportation-surge-arrests\">Guardian</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>US immigration officials are planning a month-long series of raids in May and June to deport <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/13/central-american-migration-family-children-detention-at-us-border\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"in-body-link\">hundreds of Central American mothers and children</a> found to have entered the country illegally, according to sources and an internal document seen by Reuters.</p>\n<p>The operation would likely be the largest deportation sweep targeting immigrant families by the administration of <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\">Barack Obama</a> this year after a similar drive over two days in January that focused on Georgia, Texas and North Carolina.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, the asinine part of this entire equation is that we are talking about the deportation of hundreds of people in a nation where there are\u00a0<em>millions</em> who are here illegally. And even this small number is enough to drive &#8220;immigration advocates&#8221; around the bend:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Those raids, which resulted in the detention of 121 people, mostly women and children, sparked an outcry from immigration advocates and criticism from some Democrats, including the party\u2019s presidential election frontrunner Hillary Clinton.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m really unaware of another crime that people are so willing to protest the actual enforcement of the law against. When the cops shut down a chop shop and cart a bunch of car thieves off to jail, there isn&#8217;t an organized lobby ready to protest against the very idea of punishing car thieves. Instead, the other car thieves (presumably) shake their heads and say, &#8220;oh well, we all knew that&#8217;s what would happen if we got caught.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s one thing for people to enter this country illegally in the hopes they won&#8217;t get caught. It&#8217;s another for them to say, after they get caught, that the United States doesn&#8217;t have the right to enforce their own immigration laws, which\u00a0<em>they fully knew would get them deported if they were caught</em>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/05/12/obama-administration-plans-major-deportation-raids/\">Obama Administration Plans Major Deportation Raids</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com\">RedState</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/05/12/obama-administration-plans-major-deportation-raids/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>2</slash:comments>\n\t<enclosure url=\"http://www.redstate.com/uploads/2016/05/2016_05_12_205221_14-300x200.jpg\" length=\"23375\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>A Proposal for Bathroom Warriors of the Left</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.redstate.com/sweetie15/2016/05/12/proposal-bathroom-warriors-left/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.redstate.com/sweetie15/2016/05/12/proposal-bathroom-warriors-left/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 19:30:06 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"/sweetie15/\">Susan Wright</a> (<a href=\"/diary/sweetie15/\">Diary</a>)]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured Story]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Front Page Stories]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.redstate.com/?p=294966</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Let the market prove the need. </p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com/sweetie15/2016/05/12/proposal-bathroom-warriors-left/\">A Proposal for Bathroom Warriors of the Left</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com\">RedState</a>.</p>]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past week, we\u2019ve seen the federal government threaten the state of North Carolina with a lawsuit for non-compliance to a liberal agenda.</p>\n<p>That agenda was first forced on the state of North Carolina by way of a Charlotte, NC city ordinance, that would have allowed for anyone, male or female, to go into whatever bathroom they felt like going into. It would have been a city-wide mandate and would have allowed for sexual predators to gain easier access to their victims, under the law, and would have gone into effect on April 1, 2016.</p>\n<p>The Republican-led NC General Assembly called a special session and quickly passed House Bill 2, which would limit bathroom and shower room access to the gender an individual was born to \u2013 not \u201cassigned,\u201d little snowflakes \u2013 <strong>born</strong>.</p>\n<p>The bill went to the desk of Governor Pat McCrory and was signed into law.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s when the fighting started.</p>\n<p>The gay mafia is ever outrage-ready, like most leftwing professional victims, and leapt at the chance to make this about them. This was a chance to point at conservatives and cry out about their great oppression.</p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s the truth.</p>\n<p>Governor McCrory encouraged businesses and the school systems to make arrangements for single-occupancy bathrooms, in order to accommodate those who suffer from Gender Dysphoria (the clinical name for the mental illness that makes .03% of the population believe they\u2019re of a different sex than what they really are).</p>\n<p>Whenever you hear of these cases, however, it\u2019s never a school where 4 or 5 students are ravaged with mental illness and need to have special bathrooms to accommodate their dysfunction. It\u2019s always one really messed up kid making the news.</p>\n<p>In an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, where the stolid Tapper tried to make the emotional case for some imaginary 12-year old transgender who would be effected by HB2, Governor McCrory made a solid point: He was worried about the safety and comfort of the <em>other </em>students, as well.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ICYMI?src=hash\">#ICYMI</a>, Gov.

Usually to someone who doesn&#8217;t deserve it, often with the cheerleading, or by the design, of <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/05/12/concha-dana-loeschs-excuse-attack-trump-pundit-double-mastectomy-right-2nd-grade/\">Breitbart</a>. Today is of course, no exception.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, radio and TV host Dana Loesch, who I know and on whose show I have appeared, blisteringly attacked Kayleigh McEnany, one of CNN&#8217;s go-to Trump supporters. McEnany had the ridiculous gall to suggest that you can&#8217;t be a true conservative if you aren&#8217;t supporting Trump. Because those are the kind of dumb arguments Trump supports cherish. The more it goes against reality, the more they like it. So they LOVE that one.</p>\n<p>In this well-deserved flaying, Loesch happened to refer to McEnany as &#8220;flat-chested.&#8221; This is a Donald trump insult from way back. He&#8217;s gone on at length about how women&#8217;s boobs look, particularly how unattractive breasts are on women who don&#8217;t like him or agree with him or &#8220;Get on their knees&#8221; in front of him. Basically a woman is flat-chested if she has the temerity to bleed from her wherever instead of sucking on Trump&#8217;s &#8230; ideas.</p>\n<p>After this segment aired, it was reported (notice that I merely say it is reported) that McEnany is a &#8220;survivor.&#8221; She is flat-chested, they report, because she had a preventative mastectomy after finding out she has the breast cancer gene.</p>\n<p>Let me say this at the outset: My family is likewise BRCA-positive, and my sister is a <a href=\"http://www.leciawphinney.com/2015/02/inheritance.html\">soon to be published National Geographic author on the subject</a>. I agree that degrading or insulting women for being &#8220;flat chested&#8221; is beyond the pale of civilized discourse. Which is, of course, exactly the point Dana was trying to drive home by calling Kayleigh MacEnany &#8220;flat chested&#8221; &#8211; if you&#8217;re going to repeatedly defend a man who uses the term, you can&#8217;t be outraged when it is turned on you.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not Dana&#8217;s fault that the average online Trump supporter is too dim to grasp that what Dana was doing was illustrating exactly how offensive Donald Trump is.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Dana had no idea that McEnany had been through any such situation. Why would she? I don&#8217;t check the medical history of people who are on CNN or Fox or MSNBC every time I&#8217;m going to write negatively about them. Who does? And you know who else doesn&#8217;t check such things? Donald Trump. Do you think he had any idea about which <em>specific</em> disability afflicted\u00a0Serge Kovaleski when he <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/donald-trump-mocks-new-york-times-reporter-serge-kovaleski-216219\">savagely mocked him for it on live television</a>?</p>\n<p>Yes, Kayleigh, you&#8217;re living in The Donald&#8217;s world now; one you helped created. It&#8217;s what Dana has repeatedly stated that she was highlighting with her rant. There is nothing in there that Trump doesn&#8217;t say routinely, both before and <em>during</em> a Presidential campaign, even from the actual stage.</p>\n<p>Do we forget that he mocks disabled people? That he belittles womens&#8217;s looks? That indeed he has quite a lot of demeaning things to say about women? Do we forget that he calls people dumb and loser and liar and sweaty and &#8220;little&#8221; and &#8230; oh that&#8217;s right, FLAT CHESTED??</p>\n<p>Now there is an outrage machine in full roar. Laughably, hysterically, almost unbelievably, Trump&#8217;s shock troops from Twitter are in screaming, pearl-clutching, retribution mode. Yes, the ones who have said things about Megyn Kelly that I can&#8217;t reprint here. Yes, the ones who use the word &#8220;cuck&#8221; as an actual hashtag to identify their tweets. Yes, the ones who cheer every insult their orange leader shouts from his podium. Those people are outraged over this. And they&#8217;re pushing so hard that there is talk of a boycott of Dana&#8217;s sponsors. Seriously.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, they will slavishly march to the polls in November, wearing their &#8220;Make America Great Again&#8221; trucker hats that they bought from &#8230; someone who routinely calls women &#8220;flat chested.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s almost too much to believe. It&#8217;s almost inconceivable.</p>\n<p>But even with all that said, there are some, even among the good guys, who think it is appalling that Dana insulted the breasts of a survivor.</p>\n<p>Only she didn&#8217;t. She didn&#8217;t do that. I don&#8217;t mean because she didn&#8217;t know in advance. I mean because apparently McEnany isn&#8217;t that. She has not had breast cancer, so you can drop &#8220;survivor&#8221; right there. But even more significantly, according to <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/11/most-conservative-pubs-wont-touch-female-pundits-boobs/#ixzz48SrwzwWU\" target=\"_blank\">the Daily Caller</a>, she hasn&#8217;t had a mastectomy.</p>\n<p>Let that sink in. She hasn&#8217;t even had the procedure that is the supposed cause of the outrage. In fact, the opposite is the case. The <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/11/most-conservative-pubs-wont-touch-female-pundits-boobs/#ixzz48SrwzwWU\">Daily Caller&#8217;s Betsy Rothstein</a>, in the most buried lede in history, reports that McEnany actually had breast implants and is &#8220;planning&#8221; to have a mastectomy at some point. Now look, I don&#8217;t know whether she has or has not had a mastectomy &#8211; all I know is that the very source people are using to claim that McEnany has\u00a0<em>already</em>\u00a0<em>had</em> a mastectomy\u00a0<em>actually</em> says this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For another, McEnany <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/10/about-that-woman-dana-loesch-called-flat-chested-whoops/\" target=\"_blank\">learned in her early twenties</a> that she is BRCA 1 positive, the gene mutation for breast cancer. She had implants put in and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>is planning to follow through with a double mastectomy</strong></span>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>She hasn&#8217;t even had the surgery. She had breast implants. At least, according to <strong>the very source</strong> everyone is citing for the proposition that she&#8217;s had a mastectomy.</p>\n<p>This story is a blown-up, inflated controversy that has been planted with precision to attack an effective voice against Donald Trump. That is what this is. You may wish to stay out of it now, but if you oppose Trump, you won&#8217;t be able to stay out of it forever. His incredibly loyal, incredibly rabid army of darkness online will come for you eventually, too. Because they operate like their leader: with dishonesty, without boundary, and with extreme, despicable, visceral hatred.</p>\n<p>Watch your back.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/05/12/lets-talk-kayleigh-mcenanys-boobs/\">Let&#8217;s Talk About Kayleigh McEnany&#8217;s Boobs</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com\">RedState</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/05/12/lets-talk-kayleigh-mcenanys-boobs/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t<enclosure url=\"http://www.redstate.com/uploads/2016/05/2016_05_12_180236_6-300x127.jpg\" length=\"18021\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Our next President must rebuild the Navy</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.redstate.com/neil_stevens/2016/05/12/next-president-must-rebuild-navy/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.redstate.com/neil_stevens/2016/05/12/next-president-must-rebuild-navy/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:30:40 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"/neil_stevens/\">Neil Stevens</a> (<a href=\"/diary/neil_stevens/\">Diary</a>)]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured Story]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Front Page Stories]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Navy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[OFRP]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.redstate.com/?p=294952</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>The Government Accountability office has reviewed the Navy&#8217;s operations, according to a requirement placed in the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).

The key points:</p>\n<p><strong>Maintenance is taking too long</strong>.  The implementation of the <a href=\"http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=78649\">Optimized Fleet Response Plan (OFRP)</a>, a 2014 plan to improve our ability to get ships out to sea, didn&#8217;t fix it, either:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In summary, our analysis of Navy data for fiscal years 2011 to 2014 shows that prior to OFRP implementation the majority of maintenance availabilities completed by both the public and private shipyards took more time than scheduled, thereby reducing the time during which ships were available for training and operations. Additionally, we found that the Navy continues to experience delays on maintenance begun under the OFRP.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And worse, <strong>these problems could prevent us from employing our world-beating aircraft carriers</strong> and support ships:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In November 2014 the Navy began a multi-year process of implementing the OFRP, with the goal of maximizing ship employability while ensuring adequate time for maintenance and training and restoring operational tempo and personnel tempo rates to acceptable levels. Thus far, only a small portion of the fleet has entered an optimized cycle, and as a result it is too early to assess the OFRP\u2019s overall effectiveness. However, the first 3 aircraft carriers to enter the optimized schedule have not completed maintenance tasks on time, a benchmark that is crucial to meeting the Navy\u2019s employability goals. Further, of the 83 cruisers and destroyers, only 15 have completed a maintenance availability under OFRP.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The OFRP isn&#8217;t working.  Our carriers, cruisers, and destroyers aren&#8217;t being kept in shape. The next President must rebuild these ships, get them at sea, and make sure the US Navy is the global force for peace and prosperity it has been for decades.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com/neil_stevens/2016/05/12/next-president-must-rebuild-navy/\">Our next President must rebuild the Navy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com\">RedState</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.redstate.com/neil_stevens/2016/05/12/next-president-must-rebuild-navy/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t<enclosure url=\"http://www.redstate.com/uploads/2016/05/USSRONALDREAGANgoodshot-300x195.jpg\" length=\"22021\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Watercooler 5/12/16:Obama Declares War;Watson Evaluates Candidates:ISIS losing popularity</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.redstate.com/diary/Joliphant/2016/05/12/watercooler-51216obama-declares-warwatson-evaluates-candidatesisis-losing-popularity/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.redstate.com/diary/Joliphant/2016/05/12/watercooler-51216obama-declares-warwatson-evaluates-candidatesisis-losing-popularity/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 18:30:22 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Joliphant (<a href=\"/diary/joliphant/\">Diary</a>)]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Front Page Stories]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.redstate.com/diary/Joliphant/2016/05/12/watercooler-51216obama-declares-warwatson-evaluates-candidatesisis-losing-popularity/</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Obama Declares War &#8212; On Property Values As a parting shot before leaving office Obama has an attack on suburbia planned.

One thing most people don&#8217;t really understand about Obamacare as it was passed, but which is probably the most fatal flaw in the law, is that it created a financially unsound system and prohibited insurers from reacting to the market adjustments by law.</p>\n<p>The Obama administration has been busy trying to prevent the whole system from collapsing (and taking the private insurance market with it) by taking a series of blatantly unlawful unilateral actions to essentially rewrite the entire law &#8211; from erasing or rewriting deadlines, to offering unlawful credits to consumers who were on national exchanges (a program that was only saved by the political cowardice of John Roberts), and so forth.</p>\n<p>The administration&#8217;s latest ploy has been to essentially bail out private insurers whose balance sheets have been decimated by participation in Obamacare with taxpayer dollars, in spite of the fact that the law contains no such provision. The administration&#8217;s &#8220;defense&#8221; to their action essentially was that the law said we can give tax credits to consumers so surely that means we can give them to insurers too, right? The first <a href=\"http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/279695-judge-rules-for-house-gop-in-obamacare-suit\">Federal judge to rule on the question disagrees</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A federal judge on Thursday ruled for House Republicans in their lawsuit against the Obama administration over ObamaCare.</p>\n<p>In a major ruling, Judge Rosemary Collyer,\u00a0an appointee of President George W. Bush, said the administration does not have the power to spend money on &#8220;cost sharing reduction&#8221; payments to insurers without an appropriation from Congress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Given that the Supreme Court has already twice saved the law from a catastrophe of its own making, it&#8217;s hard to imagine that they won&#8217;t a third time, especially now that Justice Scalia has passed away. Granted, the stakes are at least theoretically lower in this case since there&#8217;s not even really an argument that the insurer bailouts are an essential part of the law, not even if you squint hard, but SCOTUS long ago decided to act as a rubber stamp for the administration&#8217;s unilateral actions in implementing Obamacare, and it&#8217;s hard to see this case being decided any differently.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/05/12/federal-judge-strikes-obamacare-insurer-bailouts/\">Federal Judge Strikes Down Obamacare Insurer Bailouts</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com\">RedState</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/05/12/federal-judge-strikes-obamacare-insurer-bailouts/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>3</slash:comments>\n\t<enclosure url=\"http://www.redstate.com/uploads/2016/02/obama-smirk-shutterstock-300x200.jpg\" length=\"9160\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>The Minimum Wage for Robots is Zero so Wendy&#8217;s Hires a Bunch</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/05/12/minimum-wage-robots-zero-wendys-hires-bunch/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/05/12/minimum-wage-robots-zero-wendys-hires-bunch/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:30:53 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"/leon_h_wolf/\">Leon H.

There is absolutely no amount of government action that is going to undo that.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not politically correct to say this, but if you&#8217;re making minimum wage, you&#8217;re probably doing a job that could be pretty easily replaced by a modern technological innovation. The only thing that prevents your employer for doing this is the one time sunk cost of buying that technology. Your employer most likely has figured out the exact tipping point, salary-wise, that makes buying that robot or computer terminal or whatever worth it &#8211; and the more the government forces him to pay you, the more likely your job is to cease to exist.</p>\n<p>And thus we see that Wendy&#8217;s has announced a massive program to install <a href=\"http://twitchy.com/gregp-3534/2016/05/12/progressive-economics-strikes-again-wendys-proves-that-the-real-minimum-wage-is-actually-0-00/\">automated terminals in 6,000 of their restaurants</a> &#8211; terminals that won&#8217;t walk out of work on random days demanding to be paid $15 an hour.</p>\n<p>On the whole, this is a net benefit for society. The invention of the automatic ditch digger means better ditches can be dug faster and cheaper, and isn&#8217;t it great that we don&#8217;t have to dig ditches in the hot sun every day? But if you&#8217;re a person who&#8217;s never learned to do anything for a living but dig a ditch, it&#8217;s a problem.</p>\n<p>The problem is only made worse by fundamentally dishonest politicians who are peddling false dreams to people who need to come to grips with economic reality. Donald Trump stands in front of huge rallies in West Virginia and promises laid off coal workers that he&#8217;s going to get them back to work again, but he can&#8217;t. Fracking has made natural gas cheap enough that coal simply can&#8217;t compete on price, so unless Trump plans to outlaw it and drive up energy costs, there simply aren&#8217;t enough people who want coal for that to happen. And even if they did, mountaintop removal processes have made it so much quicker (and less human labor intensive) to mine coal that there simply isn&#8217;t a massive demand for human coal miners anymore, even if the whole world ran on coal.</p>\n<p>Believe me, I can relate to the frustration of folks about jobs disappearing. I incurred six figures worth of student loan debt and spent seven years in college for a law degree that promptly became almost worthless when the entire field crashed in 2008 and suddenly found itself flooded with excess labor. Everybody hates lawyers (with good reason) so there were no politicians out there loudly proclaiming that after they got elected, they were going to make sure all the lawyers went back to work, but it sure would have sounded tempting if one had.</p>\n<p>But it still would have been a false promise and the politicians on both sides who are doing it right now to workers who are in desperate need of retraining should be ashamed of themselves.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/05/12/minimum-wage-robots-zero-wendys-hires-bunch/\">The Minimum Wage for Robots is Zero so Wendy&#8217;s Hires a Bunch</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com\">RedState</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/05/12/minimum-wage-robots-zero-wendys-hires-bunch/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>2</slash:comments>\n\t<enclosure url=\"http://www.redstate.com/uploads/2016/05/2016_05_12_152421_2-300x187.jpg\" length=\"36221\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>George Zimmerman to Auction the Gun that Killed Trayvon Martin</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.redstate.com/joesquire/2016/05/12/george-zimmerman-auction-gun-killed-trayvon-martin/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.redstate.com/joesquire/2016/05/12/george-zimmerman-auction-gun-killed-trayvon-martin/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:00:45 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"/joesquire/\">Joe Cunningham</a> (<a href=\"/diary/joesquire/\">Diary</a>)]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured Story]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Front Page Stories]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Auction]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[George Zimmerman]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Gun]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Trayvon Martin]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.redstate.com/?p=294903</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>George Zimmerman, who one instant was a model for self-defense gun ownership and use and the next was slowly losing his mind thanks to an addiction to the fifteen minutes of fame, is back at it, this time trying to piss off even more people: he&#8217;s auctioning off the gun that gun Trayvon Martin.

Zimmerman\u201d has listed the Kel-Tec PF-9 9-mm on a <a href=\"http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=558112068\">firearms-auction website</a>. The seller describes the gun as \u201can American Firearm Icon\u201d and says it was used against Trayvon Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, the night of the violent attack that <a href=\"http://time.com/3814982/walter-scott-trayvon-martin-black-men-shootings/\">sparked</a> a national debate about violence and race. Zimmerman said he acted in self-defense and was eventually <a href=\"http://nation.time.com/2013/07/14/the-next-verdict-from-the-zimmerman-trial/\">acquitted</a> of manslaughter and murder charges.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This&#8230; is really stupid. There was a time when Zimmerman could be seen as someone who is respectable and had to use a gun in a bad situation, for which he was put through a major and highly publicized trial. His life was turned upside down and he had to learn to cope with that.</p>\n<p>Except, he didn&#8217;t. He loved the media attention, and he kept striving for more, and letting his life spiral out of control afterward. It&#8217;s not completely his fault &#8211; the media did its best to make him a social pariah for the rest of his life. However, he didn&#8217;t a good job of holding his head high and staying above it all.</p>\n<p>But, don&#8217;t worry. The money from the auction is going to a good cause:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The auction statement promises a portion of the sale will be used to fight \u201cBLM violence against Law Enforcement officers,\u201d in a presumable reference to the Black Lives Matter movement, and also to combat Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201canti-firearm rhetoric.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>So&#8230; good job, I guess?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Maybe not?</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeorgeZimmerman?src=hash\">#GeorgeZimmerman</a> gun appears to have been removed from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GunBroker\">@GunBroker</a> auction website.

I have said all along that this is barely disguised performance art from both parties. Although Ryan&#8217;s stance was, to my knowledge, unprecedented, it was also unsustainable given his position in the party. Eventually, Ryan is going to come around and support Trump &#8211; it has always been so. And indeed both <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RosieGray/status/730775940993847296\">emerged from their meeting saying all the right things about making steps toward unification</a>.</p>\n<p>What Ryan is doing is signaling to other House members that if they need to run against Trump or distance themselves from Trump, he will still have their back. And he wants to slow or halt Trump&#8217;s ongoing public pivot to the left, if he can. He wants to be able to extract public concessions from Trump about sticking with some of the conservative-ish things he said in the primary before all of them are abandoned in the general.</p>\n<p>Trump, meanwhile, will say whatever he needs to say to get Ryan on board. As much as he blusters to the contrary, he does not want to run against the Speaker of the House and he wants Ryan to be RNC Convention Chair, because he can&#8217;t afford to have the convention consist entirely of his toadies. He needs to show at the convention that he&#8217;s reached reconciliation with at least some portion of his detractors &#8211; and since all the previous nominees have flatly declared that they won&#8217;t be present, Ryan presents the last major &#8220;get&#8221; that he can possibly have.</p>\n<p>In the end, I would be stunned if the two weren&#8217;t reconciled.

That flight line was full of people, and we were all ready to go\u201d to Benghazi, he said.</p>\n<p>Only they were waiting for the order. It never came.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe whole night we were told that we are waiting on a call,\u201d he told Fox News.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It has been four years since the attack that killed Navy SEALs, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, as well as U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, and information officer, Sean Smith.</p>\n<p>The source who spoke with Fox News insisted that the reports from official sources, such as the State Department Accountability Review Board and a timeline provided by the military, were inaccurate, and that his squadron could have made it to Benghazi within a three hour window, at least in time to defend against the second mortar attack (which ultimately killed Woods and Doherty).</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe could have been there. That&#8217;s the worst part,\u201d the source said.</p>\n<p>The source who spoke with Fox News challenged the military claim that a re-fueling tanker wasn\u2019t available. He said American jets routinely refuel by using what\u2019s called a \u201chot pit maneuver,\u201d which allows the jets to land and then get fuel without shutting off the engines.</p>\n<p>Multiple sources say there were multiple locations available the night of the attack.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A former team sergeant for an anti-terror quick reaction force, by the name of Mike, was present at Delta Force headquarters on that night, monitoring the events. He insists that there were hours and hours of time to \u201cdo something,\u201d and that forces were ready to go, but were shut down by policymakers, not military leaders.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Despite the claim by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the State Department that nothing more could have been done, a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit recently revealed that Department of Defense Chief of Staff Jeremy Bash immediately offered assistance to the State Department on the night of Sept. 11, saying forces could move to Benghazi and \u201cthey are spinning up as we speak.\u201d</p>\n<p>Mike echoed that: \u201cI know everything was spun up and nothing was done.\u201d</p>\n<p>He added: &#8220;At our level, we were doing everything we were supposed to be doing. At everybody else&#8217;s level above us, it was political.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>While political red tape tied the hands of the military on that night, it continues to tie the hands of those seeking answers.</p>\n<p>Democrats have called the House investigation on Benghazi, led by committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) a waste of time and money.</p>\n<p>Gowdy says they have new information, but still are struggling to gain access to witnesses.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been very frustrating,\u201d Gowdy told Fox News.</p>\n<p>In response to Fox News\u2019 reporting, he also issued a statement saying it is \u201cdeeply troubling there are individuals who would like to share their stories, but have not because they are afraid of retaliation from their superiors.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Something tells me that had a Republican president and Secretary of State been in place on that night, the Democrats would be falling all over themselves to get answers for the families of the slain.</p>\n<p>Then again, had Republicans been in place that night, the military would have been given clearance to do their jobs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com/sweetie15/2016/05/12/new-voices-benghazi-investigation-ready-go/\">New Voices in Benghazi Investigation: &#8220;We Were All Ready to Go&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com\">RedState</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.redstate.com/sweetie15/2016/05/12/new-voices-benghazi-investigation-ready-go/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<enclosure url=\"http://www.redstate.com/uploads/2014/06/151807080-300x199.jpg\" length=\"18508\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Utah Abortion Law Requires Painkillers Be Given to Unborn Before Death</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.redstate.com/kimberly_ross/2016/05/12/utah-law-requires-painkillers-given-unborn-before-death/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.redstate.com/kimberly_ross/2016/05/12/utah-law-requires-painkillers-given-unborn-before-death/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 15:00:19 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"/kimberly_ross/\">Kimberly Ross</a> (<a href=\"/diary/kimberly_ross/\">Diary</a>)]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Abortion]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured Story]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Front Page Stories]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[fetal pain]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Governor Gary Herbert]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[personhood]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Pro-Life]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Utah]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.redstate.com/?p=294844</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Ours is\u00a0a culture of death.

This is most apparent as approximately 3,000 unborn lives are sacrificed daily on the altar of &#8220;choice&#8221; by way of abortion.</p>\n<p>Although Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, many state legislatures have, in recent months, done their part to advance the pro-life cause. Governors in Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky have reduced Planned Parenthood funding, or banned abortions based on race, gender, or disability. Those at the state level have led the charge when members of Congress have not.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, a new law addressing late-term abortions in the state of Utah went into effect. It&#8217;s unlike any other type of legislation, and highlights the horrific reality of abortion like never before. As <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-utah-abortion-20160510-20160509-snap-story.html\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-utah-abortion-20160510-20160509-snap-story.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1463100494475000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFdHQDlLHPaLoP-qCk9MTcP4k8jmw\">reported</a> by the<em> L.A. Times:</em></p>\n<blockquote><p>The law&#8230;requires doctors to provide anesthesia or painkillers to women seeking an abortion 20 weeks or more into a pregnancy. The pain medication is for the fetus.</p>\n<p><strong>Under the law, doctors are required to provide pain medication to \u201calleviate organic pain to the unborn child.\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>The law also requires doctors to notify women that medical evidence shows a 20-week fetus may feel pain during an abortion.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We are all aware that unborn life is active, developing, and reacts to its surroundings in very human ways. (Example:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.lifenews.com/2015/03/24/dramatic-ultrasound-photos-show-unborn-baby-grimacing-in-womb-when-mother-smokes/\">this baby</a>, at 32 weeks gestation, grimacing and covering its face when its mother smokes.) This is because, despite location, stage of development, and refusal by the Left to assign personhood, the unborn life <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">is a person.</span></p>\n<p>The bill is clearly controversial among the pro-abort &#8220;medical&#8221; community. Leah Torres, a pro-abort OB/GYN <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-utah-abortion-20160510-20160509-snap-story.html\">says</a> the bill &#8220;criminalizes&#8221; doctors. Others say the additional\u00a0anesthesia or painkillers, meant for the baby, can harm the woman. Lost in all of this is the fact that Utah abortionists are quite literally executing unborn life because it is unwanted. What the bill essentially does is not much different than if medicine designed\u00a0to relieve suffering had been administered to\u00a0a truckload of Jews before they were sent to the gas chamber. Take away the victim&#8217;s physical pain, and discarding a life becomes easy, right?</p>\n<p>This law applies to late-term abortions alone. Currently,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/spibs/spib_PLTA.pdf\">12 states ban abortions after 20 weeks gestation</a>, the time when unborn babies are <a href=\"http://www.mccl.org/unborn-babies-can-feel-pain.html\">believed\u00a0to feel pain</a>. I would have preferred that Utah legislators pushed for an outright ban on late-term abortions.\u00a0Instead, this law seems intent on soothing feelings of regret by attempting to eliminate pain before legal homicide\u00a0can take place.</p>\n<p>While some argue over when/if an unborn child\u00a0feels pain, I have always been of the mindset that abortion is wrong regardless of what others think that answer might be. Destruction of an innocent life isn&#8217;t only wrong if\u00a0the destroyed was in anguish before the end. The pro-life climate in\u00a0Utah doesn&#8217;t seem to have improved much <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/29/health/utah-abortion-law-fetal-pain/\">with this law</a>. Instead of seeking to ban certain procedures, it feels like a cheap attempt to satisfy both sides in the ongoing abortion debate. It does no saving of lives.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com/kimberly_ross/2016/05/12/utah-law-requires-painkillers-given-unborn-before-death/\">Utah Abortion Law Requires Painkillers Be Given to Unborn Before Death</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com\">RedState</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.redstate.com/kimberly_ross/2016/05/12/utah-law-requires-painkillers-given-unborn-before-death/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<enclosure url=\"http://www.redstate.com/uploads/2016/03/AP_720815998303-300x218.jpg\" length=\"38646\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Donald Trump Made The GOP Pledge Worthless; Others Should Break It</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.redstate.com/jaycaruso/2016/05/12/donald-trump-made-gop-pledge-worthless-others-break/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.redstate.com/jaycaruso/2016/05/12/donald-trump-made-gop-pledge-worthless-others-break/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:30:41 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"/jaycaruso/\">Jay Caruso</a>]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Donald Trump]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Elections]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured Post]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Featured Story]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Front Page]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Front Page Stories]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Republicans]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.redstate.com/?p=294884</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Many people certainly had a visceral reaction to the post I wrote yesterday about Senator Marco Rubio.

Some agreed with my sentiment, others claimed I was wrong and Rubio never said he&#8217;d vote for Trump.</p>\n<p>But a number of people reacted in a way that I thought was strange. They&#8217;d reference the pledge each candidate signed saying they&#8217;d endorse whoever the nominee is and not run an independent or third party campaign in lieu of not winning the nomination.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Marco is keeping his word and that is honorable.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>I suppose but what good is keeping a pledge when one of the players is a complete phony?</p>\n<p>First of all, keep in mind what that stupid pledge was all about. Reince Priebus, scared that Donald Trump would deem the GOP was being &#8220;unfair&#8221; to him would bolt the part and run a third party or independent campaign for President, likely siphoning votes away from GOP nominee. It was not a moment of strength for the RNC Chairman but one of weakness.</p>\n<p>Second of all, Donald Trump himself said back in March the GOP pledge was null and void. Why? Trump said,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve been treated very unfairly\u201d by the RNC. Big surprise there. The &#8220;fighter&#8221; is nothing but a big crybaby. If you don&#8217;t recall him saying it, here is the video:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LFzIIeAi110\"></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Trump has done nothing but lie, smear and bully his way through the primaries. he had no problem engaging in 9/11 conspiracy theories or attaching the worst of smears to President Bush, claiming he knew there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and he lied about it in order to have a war he wanted.</p>\n<p>He lied about the records of his opponents, lied about statements they made, lied about his own positions and his own actions. The man is nearly incapable of telling the truth.</p>\n<p><strong>There is no honor in keeping a pledge to support somebody like that.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>In fact, I would go so far as to say that Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and others have a <em>moral obligation</em> to tell Reince and Donald Trump to stick their pledge where the sun doesn&#8217;t shine.</p>\n<p>About eighteen months ago, I entered into a business agreement with two other people. A couple of months into that agreement two of us found out the third person involved was kiting checks on our business bank account to the tune of over $1000. Was I somehow obligated to continue the business relationship because we had an agreement? Hell no. It wasn&#8217;t worth the paper it was printed on.</p>\n<p><strong>Neither is the GOP pledge.\u00a0</strong>There is absolutely nothing wrong with anybody from the GOP breaking it.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump is not an honorable man and he has shown that to be the case throughout the primary season. If he wants respect, it requires it be earned. His 40% of the vote does not demand it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com/jaycaruso/2016/05/12/donald-trump-made-gop-pledge-worthless-others-break/\">Donald Trump Made The GOP Pledge Worthless; Others Should Break It</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.redstate.com\">RedState</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.redstate.com/jaycaruso/2016/05/12/donald-trump-made-gop-pledge-worthless-others-break/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t<enclosure url=\"http://www.redstate.com/uploads/2016/03/TrumpHead-300x169.jpg\" length=\"13082\" type=\"image/jpeg\" />\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>New Oregon Poll Has a Shockingly Depressing Result for Trump (AND Hillary)</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/05/12/new-oregon-poll-shockingly-depressing-result-trump/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.redstate.com/leon_h_wolf/2016/05/12/new-oregon-poll-shockingly-depressing-result-trump/#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:00:11 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[<a href=\"/leon_h_wolf/\">Leon H.

The sample was taken from May 6-9th &#8211; which is to say, all surveys were conducted\u00a0<em>after\u00a0</em>both John Kasich and Ted Cruz had dropped out of the race. The poll tested the Democratic primary (Hillary leads Bernie 48-33) and a general election matchup between Hillary and Trump (Hillary leads again, 43-32).</p>\n<p>For reasons that are not entirely clear, the poll also tested the Republican primary, which isn&#8217;t even contested anymore. And this is where things get bad for Trump &#8211; because he didn&#8217;t even clear 50% in the polls even though his opponents aren&#8217;t in the race anymore. According to this poll, he pulls in 45% of likely Republican voters, but 28% of likely Republican voters said they intended to vote for Cruz and/or Kasich\u00a0<em>even though both had already dropped out before the survey started</em>. Another 27% responded &#8220;unsure&#8221; even though\u00a0<em>there&#8217;s only one choice left</em>.</p>\n<p>Doesn&#8217;t really indicate that the whole &#8220;unity&#8221; thing Trump has been pushing is going all that well.</p>\n<p>Still, Trump is doing respectably well against Hillary in Oregon, but some of the poll&#8217;s internals show that this could be one of the worst Presidential elections in history.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Those numbers shouldn\u2019t be seen as a ringing endorsement for either candidate, however. Among potential Trump voters, 52\u00a0percent\u00a0said their vote was based more on their dislike of Clinton than Trump\u2019s appeal. Among Clinton supporters, 43\u00a0percent said they were supporting her because they dislike\u00a0him.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is gonna get ugly, folks.
