We have. And like Nathan Drake looting a cadaver's chest for enchanted organs, the game has stolen our hearts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's 5 reasons why &lt;em&gt;Uncharted: Fortune Hunter&lt;/em&gt; is better than &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Uncharted%3A+Fortune+Hunter/feature.asp?c=70047'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Uncharted%3A+Fortune+Hunter/feature.asp?c=70047</link>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 20:59:31 GMT</pubDate>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Ultimate Chicken Horse brings chaotic competitive multiplayer action to NVIDIA SHIELD</title>\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/imgthumbs/na-kmpmx/uch_02.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Ultimate Chicken Horse brings chaotic competitive multiplayer action to NVIDIA SHIELD&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; Now available to download on &lt;a href=&quot;http://gethatch.com/iceleads_rest/merch/44623/go?region=US&amp;affiliate_id=52378&amp;url_id=9129&quot;&gt;NVIDIA SHIELD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ap.rtb-media.me/redirect/Article-128-Ultimate-Chicken-Horse-on-Google-Play&quot;&gt;Ultimate Chicken Horse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a vibrant multiplayer platformer in which players take on the role of a chicken, horse, or racoon - as well as unlockable characters such as a chameleon, robot rabbit, and squirrel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The objective is simple yet hilariously over-the-top: race across obstacle-filled levels in an effort to reach the finish line before your animal opponents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While its premise might sound straightforward, the game becomes a great deal more frantic and fun as players set a variety of traps and obstacles in levels to sabotage other players so that they can reach the end of the level first. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Nvidia+news/news.asp?c=70018'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Nvidia+news/news.asp?c=70018</link>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Mortal Kombat X celebrates one year anniversary with biggest update yet</title>\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/imgthumbs/na-ezwp/ipad-screenshot-5.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Mortal Kombat X celebrates one year anniversary with biggest update yet&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; Nobody likes blood and fighting more than the cast of Mortal Kombat. Seriously, those folks have some issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this latest update for Mortal Kombat X adds the largest amount of content to the game yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There's a brand new Faction War Store and Currency. Blood Rubies are now obtained during the Faction Wars, and can be used in a brand new store filled with a variety of different items.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The leaderboards have been tweaked and there will be more frequent Faction War seasons so players have more chances to win stuff.&#160;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who doesn't like winning stuff?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rewards include two new Gold Characters, Kobu Jutsu Tanya and Dark Emperor Liu Kang, as well as new equipment like the Bloody Shokan Armor, Bloody Voodoo Doll and Bloody Tomahawk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New challenge characters will also be added to the game overtime, and players will be able to get new skins for classic characters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Mortal+Kombat+X/news.asp?c=70046'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Mortal+Kombat+X/news.asp?c=70046</link>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:07:43 GMT</pubDate>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Review: INKS - Unleash your inner Pollock with this colourful pinball game</title>\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/imgthumbs/na-jqasy/inks-ios-3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;INKS - Unleash your inner Pollock with this colourful pinball game&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; Pinball usually involves huge tables comprising glass, metal, plastic, and blinking lights (or digital versions thereof).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it's initially strange to stare at the sparse tables of &lt;em&gt;INKS&lt;/em&gt;, which sit halfway between papercraft and tastefully minimal modern interface design.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are nods to textures, but the tables here are mostly flat flippers, flat bumpers, and a bunch of coloured targets. It's only when you start thwacking a ball about that the game comes to life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The gimmick is that the targets emit an explosion of ink when hit. When the ball trundles through these splats, it leaves trails across the table, which becomes a kind of modern art canvas. Beyond looking pretty, this showcases how good (or bad) your aim is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike traditional pinball, &lt;em&gt;INKS&lt;/em&gt; isn't about missions, high scores, or even staying alive for long periods. Instead, it's mobile-oriented and bite-sized. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/INKS/review.asp?c=70037'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/INKS/review.asp?c=70037</link>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Massive MMO Elsword: Evolution now on iOS and Android</title>\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/thumbs/na-mjpu_img_1385_png_100.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Massive MMO Elsword: Evolution now on iOS and Android&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; Hugely successful MMORPG &lt;em&gt;Elsword: Evolution&lt;/em&gt; has made the jump to mobile and can be downloaded on &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/SG/app/id1092434028/id1092434028?mt=8&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koramgame.ggplay.elswordcbt&amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This anime-themed MMO takes players to the world of Elrios and is filled with 3D graphics and intense side-scrolling levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game has been redesigned to take advantage of touch-sensitive controls, making it seamless for users to defend the magical El Stone and those it protects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elsword&lt;/em&gt; features three character classes at launch, with a further six to be added over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The PvE mode pits you against hundreds of enemies in a variety of quests where you can collect gold and XP. You'll earn huge rewards for beating bosses, but can summon mounts to stand by your side and upgrade abilities to improve your capabilities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Elsword%3A+Evolution/news.asp?c=70032'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Elsword%3A+Evolution/news.asp?c=70032</link>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>5 Slither.io-style mash-ups we'd love to see</title>\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/imgthumbs/na-kcwl/image.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;5 Slither.io-style mash-ups we'd love to see&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; Games like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;r/Android/Agario/review.asp?c=66459&quot;&gt;Agar.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;r/iPad/Slitherio/review.asp?c=69865&quot;&gt;Slither.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; have taken over the App Store charts, thanks to their feisty multiplayer fun, and the sheer joy of getting bigger and bigger and bigger until you're the biggest big thing there has ever been.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So perhaps some other developers could borrow this formula to bring their games to mobile. With that in mind, here are 5 franchises that should get the .io treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Katamar.io&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You saw this one coming. This trippy cult classic is about a teeny tiny prince who rolls up everyday objects to make enormous great balls of garbage, before giving them to his dad. Who just so happens to be the king of space. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Slitherio/feature.asp?c=70026'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Slitherio/feature.asp?c=70026</link>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Maim Street is the debut title from So Choice Softworks</title>\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/thumbs/na-rufgy_screen_8_png_100.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Maim Street is the debut title from So Choice Softworks&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; &lt;strong&gt;[Update] &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maim Street &lt;/em&gt;is out &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/maim-street/id1022239163?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4&quot;&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;&#160;on iOS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This one looks properly quirky and violent and could just be up your street.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maim Street&lt;/em&gt; definitely fulfils the wanton destruction combined with evangelist passio quota.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maim Street&lt;/em&gt; has also received a brand new release trailer which you can view here.&#160;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's half live action, half gameplay, but it definitely gets the message across.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let us know if you play the game in the comments section below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#160;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Original Story] &lt;/strong&gt;Mobile gamers are used to crossing roads.

You can either drag your finger around in different directions to move the worm, or you can use a virtual stick-styled guide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This makes it much easier to get around, play with one hand, and be a bit more daring with your moves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, the update added some new skins which let you change the colour of your worm to something a bit more striking and appealing.&#160;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game has also had some other tweaks and fixes, including faster rendering.&#160;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Have you tried the new control scheme? Has it improved the way you play? Which method do you prefer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let us know in the usual place.&#160; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Slitherio/news.asp?c=70045'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Slitherio/news.asp?c=70045</link>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 14:44:19 GMT</pubDate>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Ezio Auditore joins Soul Hunters as a playable character</title>\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/imgthumbs/na-bkez/unnamed__2_.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Ezio Auditore joins Soul Hunters as a playable character&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;Soul Hunters&lt;/em&gt; continues its dominating brand presence with the inclusion of Ezio Auditore as a playable character.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting today, you can select Ezio in the game and use his signature weapons and attributes to quell all foes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This collaboration between Lilith Games and Ubisoft is to help &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/iPad/Assassin's+Creed+Identity/review.asp?c=69207&quot;&gt;Assassin's Creed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; gain further recognition in Asian gaming markets, while also introducing &lt;em&gt;Soul Hunters&lt;/em&gt; to a broader audience in North America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soul Hunters&lt;/em&gt; has already been played by over 80 million people though - so it does alright for itself - but this crossover certainly won't do it any harm either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You create and lead a party of heroes into various battles across eight different kingdoms in order to free them from a terrible curse. The battles are set in real-time and focus on strategic gameplay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Soul+Hunters/news.asp?c=70044'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Soul+Hunters/news.asp?c=70044</link>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:25:53 GMT</pubDate>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Review: LG G5</title>\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/imgthumbs/na-sdbb/lgg5-06.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;LG G5&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; LG made quite a splash when it unveiled the G5 earlier this year. The phone's unique modular design instantly set it apart from other handsets, offering the promise of a device which can be upgraded over time rather than replaced entirely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now the phone is here, it's time to see if this intriguing concept can possibly live up to the hype - and if LG has released a product which will allow it to outshine tenacious rivals like Samsung, HTC and Sony.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first glance, the G5 hardly sets your pulse racing. Compared to the wacky leather-backed G4 which preceded it, the handset is altogether unremarkable looking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be a real stretch to call it unattractive, but the rounded corners and largely plain back panel just make it blend in with the crowd rather than stand out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/LG+G5/hardware_review.asp?c=70041'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/LG+G5/hardware_review.asp?c=70041</link>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Vainglory Spring Season Championships going to Hollywood and Berlin in June</title>\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/thumbs/na-tsgs_na-getticketsnow_png_100.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Vainglory Spring Season Championships going to Hollywood and Berlin in June&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/r/iPhone/Vainglory/review.asp?c=62584&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vainglory&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;has become&#160;something of an eSports phenomenon, and now that Super Evil are working in partnership with Twitch, the future is getting brighter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Spring Season Championships will be heading to Hollywood, California and Berlin, Germany this June.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Championships start on June 3-5 in Hollywood's Avalon, then on June 10-12 they move to Berlin's Admiralspalast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The championships will be broadcast exclusively on Twitch and presented by their dedicated Vainglory eSports team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;North American champion Team SoloMid will defend their current title against Hammers esports, Nemesis Hydra, Noble esports and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, two-time European champions Team Secret will face comers such as G2 Esports, SK Gaming and mousesports.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Viewership for the Autumn and Winter Season Championships exceeded all expectations and had more than 1.5 million views on Twitch alone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Vainglory/news.asp?c=70043'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Vainglory/news.asp?c=70043</link>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Blindway is a memory maze puzzler, out now</title>\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/imgthumbs/na-tbhno/screen480x480.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Blindway is a memory maze puzzler, out now&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; A small Finnish independent games studio has just released &lt;em&gt;Blindway&lt;/em&gt; for iOS and Android.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game shows you how to reach the exit, then tasks you with drawing it from memory once you put your finger on the screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You'll also need to draw carefully so you don't hit any walls or obstalces along the way. Some levels will also feature buttons which need to be pressed to open doors.&#160;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are 3 stars to collect in each level, dependent on how many mistakes you make and how quickly you beat the level.&#160;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developers are also keen to keep adding regular content and we're being told more challenging levels will be added soon.&#160;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You can grab &lt;em&gt;Blindway&lt;/em&gt; for free on both &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/blindway/id1095013370&quot;&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nipadidit.blindway&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; right now.&#160;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Blindway+10/news.asp?c=70042'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Blindway+10/news.asp?c=70042</link>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 12:03:18 GMT</pubDate>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Ubisoft and 20th Century Fox reveal Assassin's Creed movie trailer</title>\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/imgthumbs/na-vlzsbp/22A_AC_27x40_Intl_1Sheet_UK.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Ubisoft and 20th Century Fox reveal Assassin's Creed movie trailer&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; Several years in the making, Ubisoft and 20th Century Fox finally showed off the first trailer for &lt;a href=&quot;/r/iPad/Assassin's+Creed+Identity/review.asp?c=69207&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin's Creed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;the movie on Jimmy Kimmel Live last night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's a busy year for game-to-film adaptations with &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/PS+Vita/Ratchet+%26+Clank+HD+Trilogy/review.asp?c=60529&quot;&gt;Ratchet &amp; Clank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; already in cinemas, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/iPhone/Angry+Birds+(iPhone)/review.asp?c=17385&quot;&gt;Angry Birds: The Movie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; hitting tomorrow, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/iPad/Hearthstone%3A+Heroes+of+Warcraft/review.asp?c=69916&quot;&gt;Warcraft: The Beginning &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;coming at the end of the month, and &lt;em&gt;Asassin's Creed&lt;/em&gt; releasing on December 21st.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The music in the trailer is questionable and some of the dialogue leaves a bit to be desired, but the cinematography looks quite spectacular. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Assassin%27s+Creed+Identity/news.asp?c=70040'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Assassin%27s+Creed+Identity/news.asp?c=70040</link>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 11:38:00 GMT</pubDate>\n</item>\n<item>\n<title>Slayaway Camp teases 80's themed horror in new trailer</title>\n<description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.pocketgamer.co.uk/artwork/imgthumbs/na-cejuc/5.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;Slayaway Camp teases 80's themed horror in new trailer&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;margin:5px 10px 10px 0px;&quot;&gt; Blue Wizard Digital has put together a teaser trailer for their upcoming slash-em-up &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/iPhone/Slayaway+Camp/news.asp?c=69969&quot;&gt;Slayaway Camp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and also released some new game details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's predictably gross - in its own bloody, blocky way - but has a fantastic soundtrack and a glorious looking 80's filter which even puts &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/PS+Vita/Hotline+Miami/review.asp?c=51891&quot;&gt;Hotline Miami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to shame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jason Kapalka, co-founder of Popcap says he 'felt very limited ... as we couldn't have truly graphic violence in something like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/r/iPhone/Bejeweled+2+(iPhone)/review.asp?c=7681&quot;&gt;Bejeweled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'With this game, I've finally been able to bring extreme horror to the puzzle genre.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slayaway Camp&lt;/em&gt; puts you in control of a series of killers and the goal is to slay and eliminate all teenagers in each level by completing logic puzzles &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Slayaway+Camp/news.asp?c=70039'&gt;[read more]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description>\n<link>http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/Android/Slayaway+Camp/news.asp?c=70039</link>\n<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 11:05:58 GMT</pubDate>\n</item>\n</channel>\n</rss>\n",
