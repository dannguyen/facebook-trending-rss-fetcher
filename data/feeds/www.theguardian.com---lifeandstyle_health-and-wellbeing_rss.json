It\u2019s a healthy alternative to coffee, it tastes great \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to make your own&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a drink fit for Midas, with an ochre colour so vivid it doesn\u2019t need an Instagram filter. It\u2019s not made of gold, but it might as well be, given its cult following. \u201cGolden milk\u201d or turmeric latte \u2013 an unlikely combination of nut milk and juiced turmeric root \u2013 is 2016\u2019s drink of choice. In a new report on food trends in the US, Google singled out turmeric\u2019s ascent after searches for the spice increased &lt;a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/2016-food-trends-google.html\"&gt;by 56% from November 2015 to January 2016&lt;/a&gt;. And fuelling that rise is its use in lattes: \u201cgolden milk\u201d is among the top online searches associated with the spice. Turmeric lattes are now being sold at cafes from Sydney to San Francisco, and the drink is gaining fans in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=\"http://modernbaker.com\"&gt;Modern Baker in Summertown, Oxford&lt;/a&gt;, sales of turmeric lattes \u2013 listed on the menu as \u201cGolden mylk\u201d (the \u201cy\u201d is health-speak for non-cow milk) now outnumber that of regular lattes. Turmeric lattes routinely feature in reviews for the York outpost of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.filmoreandunion.com/\"&gt;Filmore &amp;amp; Union&lt;/a&gt; restaurant chain. &lt;a href=\"http://namafoods.com\"&gt;Nama, a vegan restaurant in Notting Hill, west London,&lt;/a&gt; has noticed a surge in the turmeric latte\u2019s popularity recently, even though it has sold the drink for nearly two years. A prescient former employee used to whip them up for the staff, and they went down so well that the latte ended up on the menu. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/11/turmeric-latte-golden-milk-cult-following-alternative-coffee\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/milk\">Milk</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/softdrinks\">Soft drinks</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/indian\">Indian food and drink</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/coffee\">Coffee</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink\">Food &amp; drink</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/nutrition\">Nutrition</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 15:15:03 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/11/turmeric-latte-golden-milk-cult-following-alternative-coffee</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a91f68a4ece295c7051cc97b9577e2d5244a745/0_176_3264_1958/3264.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=46d936d38b7383c9490965872af991ce\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: NAMA foods</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a91f68a4ece295c7051cc97b9577e2d5244a745/0_176_3264_1958/3264.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=976a0f8aad215526df2dbca8d8faa264\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: NAMA foods</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Saba Imtiaz</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-11T15:15:03Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Aquajogging: how, when and why to try it</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2016/may/11/aquajogging-how-when-and-why-to-try-it</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kelly Holmes and other athletes find jogging underwater perfect for staying fit without impacting the legs \u2013 and it might even improve your form on land&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Injuries happen to all runners regardless of age, ability or experience. Aquajogging, otherwise known as deepwater running, is a great way of staying fit while injured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The double Olympic champion Kelly Holmes was an early proponent. In 2000, Holmes suffered a calf injury and could only resume track training six weeks before the Sydney Olympics, where she won the bronze medal. This remarkable achievement was made possible by her use of aquajogging to maintain an extremely high level of fitness as the injury healed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2016/may/11/aquajogging-how-when-and-why-to-try-it\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/running\">Running</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fitness\">Fitness</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/swimming\">Swimming</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2016 07:30:06 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2016/may/11/aquajogging-how-when-and-why-to-try-it</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04ce273522fe7cfe371f6f88709bb3bdbbbcd5d3/0_434_4499_2700/4499.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b9213ce65e84177df7355325a85fff5f\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Alamy</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04ce273522fe7cfe371f6f88709bb3bdbbbcd5d3/0_434_4499_2700/4499.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=14d154b4a0dbc5938a9efe120ceceb04\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Alamy</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Jake Shelley</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-11T07:30:06Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Sandwiches are toast: why we swapped sliced bread for wraps and salads</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/sandwiches-toast-swapped-sliced-bread-wraps-salads</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sales of packaged loaves are down as consumers turn to alternative breads \u2013 or avoid baked goods altogether. Is this the end of the packed lunch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time someone tells you something is the best thing since sliced bread, you might want to take it with a generous pinch of salt. According to data from market analysts Kantar Worldpanel, nearly 80 years after it first hit the shelves in this country, we\u2019re falling out of love with the ready-wrapped loaf \u2013 sales are down by 50m units over the last 12 months, despite the fact that it has never been cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bread is often at the frontline of price cuts as retailers attempt to lure customers back with discounted basics. But although the average price of a loaf dropped from 98p to 90p in 2015, it seems that is just not enough to tempt us back. Sales had been in slow decline for decades, but it was the Atkins diet, a radical weightloss plan based on a low-carb regime, whose popularity peaked in Britain in the early noughties, that sent them into freefall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/sandwiches-toast-swapped-sliced-bread-wraps-salads\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/bread\">Bread</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sandwiches\">Sandwiches</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink\">Food &amp; drink</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/nutrition\">Nutrition</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/fooddrinks\">Food &amp; drink industry</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 16:27:19 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/sandwiches-toast-swapped-sliced-bread-wraps-salads</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/826358b393af9e89b5e7194d7870f25392d616c8/0_1966_5500_3300/5500.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=513e9cee15fafa6cc81b8df4b7347cff\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Alamy</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/826358b393af9e89b5e7194d7870f25392d616c8/0_1966_5500_3300/5500.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=5fd208cff6c32664430e329fd8553af8\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Alamy</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Felicity Cloake</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-09T16:27:19Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Break the period taboo: my name is Lindy West and I bleed</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/break-period-taboo-lindy-west-book-shrill</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this second exclusive extract from her new book, Shrill, West dares to imagine a world where girls feel free to talk about menstruation in shouts instead of whispers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/08/perfect-body-lie-believed-long-time-let-shrink-my-life-lindy-west\"&gt;The \u2018perfect body\u2019 is a lie. I believed it for a long time and let it shrink my life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you\u2019re a little kid, everyone talks about your period like it\u2019s going to be a party bus to WOOOOOOOOOO! Mountain. It\u2019s all romantic metaphors about \u201cblossoming gardens\u201d and \u201cunfurling crotch orchids\u201d, and kids buy into it because they don\u2019t know what a euphemism is because they are 11. But it\u2019s also a profoundly secret thing \u2013 a confidence for closed-door meetings between women. Those two contradictory approaches (\u201cperiods are the best!\u201d and \u201cwe must never ever speak of them\u201d), made me feel as if I was the only not-brainwashed one in a culty dystopian novel. \u201cOh, yes, you can\u2019t imagine the joy readings in your subjectivity port when the Administration gifts you your woman\u2019s flow! SPEAKING OF THE FLOW OUTSIDE OF THE MENARCHE BUNKER WILL RESULT IN DEACTIVATION.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality, of course, is that when you hit puberty you don\u2019t magically blossom into a woman \u2013 you\u2019re still the same tiny fool you were at puberty-minus-one, only now, once a month, hot brown blood just glops and glops out of your private area like a broken Slurpee machine. For ever. Or, at least, until you\u2019re inconceivably elderly, in an 11-year-old\u2019s estimation. Don\u2019t worry, to deal, you just have to cork up your hole with this thing that\u2019s like a severed toe made out of cotton (and if you don\u2019t swap it out often enough, your legs fall off and you die). Or you wear a diaper. Also, your uterus is knives and you poop a bunch and you\u2019re hormonal and you get acne.

As always come and share your weekend\u2019s exploits below the line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Standing at the start line of a race when you have absolutely no idea what\u2019s going on or what anyone is saying (except that they\u2019re clearly very excited) is somewhat disorientating. Add in that it\u2019s 8pm, pitch dark and somewhere on the shores of a huge lake in Japan and you can see why I vaguely wondered if I was dreaming. After about a mile of the race, we made a right turn and looking back, at a winding stream of headlights blinking across a narrow path between fields, to the sound of the loudest insects I\u2019ve ever heard, and I was almost sure I was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the Japan leg of the Wings for Life World Run, a race I somehow managed to win in the UK last year. Given the incredible distances reached by the Japanese winners \u2013 and others across the world \u2013 before they were \u201ccaught\u201d by the catcher car, I wouldn\u2019t have stood a chance this year, so I decided to get to about 15 miles, easy pace, then jog. In fact, it turns out that 10 miles of walking around stunning Kyoto earlier in the day makes even easy pace seem hard very early on, and with the humidity, I was struggling by 10 miles. I got to 15 and stopped, waiting for the car and enjoying the sight of those bob of headlights streaming towards me. You might see more by day, but night-time running like this is an incredible experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2016/may/09/how-was-your-weekend-running\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/running\">Running</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fitness\">Fitness</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 13:00:48 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2016/may/09/how-was-your-weekend-running</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a6aed4f94aecc82cc3688b0ccba197670c00ce6/0_54_2129_1278/2129.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=759616a3b4b98268057f52f64d459314\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Mark Dadswell/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a6aed4f94aecc82cc3688b0ccba197670c00ce6/0_54_2129_1278/2129.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a559e8c42febffd612bb267d17790b70\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Mark Dadswell/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Kate Carterin Japan</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-09T13:00:48Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>City planners tap into wealth of cycling data from Strava tracking app</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/city-planners-cycling-data-strava-tracking-app</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seventy-six cities and regions are using Strava Metro data to help assess and shape transport policy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheila Lyons recalls the way Oregon used to collect data on how many people rode bikes. \u201cIt was very haphazard, two-hour counts done once a year,\u201d said the woman in charge of cycling policy for the state government. \u201cVolunteers, sitting on the street corner because they wanted better bike facilities. Pathetic, really.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 2013 a colleague had an idea. She recorded her own bike rides using an app called &lt;a href=\"https://www.strava.com/\"&gt;Strava&lt;/a&gt;, and thought: why not ask the company to share its data? And so was born &lt;a href=\"http://metro.strava.com/\"&gt;Strava Metro&lt;/a&gt;, both an inadvertent tech business spinoff and a similarly accidental urban planning tool, one that is now quietly helping to reshape streets in more than 70 places around the world and counting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/city-planners-cycling-data-strava-tracking-app\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cycling\">Cycling</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fitness\">Fitness</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apps\">Apps</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gps\">GPS</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/technology\">Technology</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world\">World news</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/cities\">Cities</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 07:26:06 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/city-planners-cycling-data-strava-tracking-app</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/901839c262dc7cfc3995682fe9ce5e49295895ab/136_294_4815_2888/4815.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=93c913285ed77f6d0f7b9b628afcfc7a\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Timothy J.

So could mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) play a part in reducing that figure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was a junior doctor, I dreaded the back pain clinic. You had a few minutes with each patient to talk through their months of debilitating pain. There was little to offer in terms of relief. Fast forward and back pain is only getting worse. A report from the University of Washington in Seattle found that while people live longer, they feel healthy for fewer years because of backache. So what can help relieve pain and reduce the annual &lt;a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/583948/back-pain-experts\" title=\"\"&gt;10m days lost from work each year in the UK due to backache&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends on the cause, but exercise, spinal manipulation and painkillers such as codeine (a weak opiod) and paracetamol are often recommended. Taking&amp;nbsp;opiods for years can make people dependent and invariably causes constipation. Guidance from Nice, which is being updated, also &lt;a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Back-pain/Pages/Treatment.aspx\" title=\"\"&gt;recommends cognitive behavioural therapy&lt;/a&gt; (CBT) \u2013 training to change how people think and behave when they have pain, which is&amp;nbsp;notoriously hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/can-mindfulness-help-ease-back-pain-mbsr\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/mindfulness\">Mindfulness</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/back-pain\">Back pain</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/society\">Society</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 07:15:08 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/can-mindfulness-help-ease-back-pain-mbsr</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08fc867f536840b885fb9f2f5b18ae25ad2fccd8/0_0_5414_3250/5414.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=40dc984b4d1de23508c9f8d11fe284de\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Tom Merton/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08fc867f536840b885fb9f2f5b18ae25ad2fccd8/0_0_5414_3250/5414.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=1a6165c643c8be332bfa5e691ed77021\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Tom Merton/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Luisa Dillner Dillner</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-09T07:15:08Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>The \u2018perfect body\u2019 is a lie.

In this exclusive extract from her new book, Shrill, she explains how society\u2019s fixation on thinness warps women\u2019s lives \u2013 and why she would rather be \u2018fat\u2019 than \u2018big\u2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve always been a great big person. In the months after I was born, the doctor was so alarmed by the circumference of my head that she insisted my parents bring me back, over and over, to be weighed and measured and held up for scrutiny next to the \u201cnormal\u201d babies. My head was \u201coff the charts\u201d, she said. Science literally had not produced a chart expansive enough to account for my monster dome. \u201cOff the charts\u201d became a West family joke over the years \u2013 I always deflected it, saying it was because of my giant brain \u2013 but I absorbed the message nonetheless. I was too big, from birth. Abnormally big. Medical-anomaly big.

The race is finally underway, yet you feel rundown and lacklustre. There is a &lt;a href=\"http://bmjopensem.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000063.full\"&gt;scientific term&lt;/a&gt; for it, but let\u2019s just call it a bad race day.

We can monitor our heart rates and sleep, but within five years we could have instant access to a whole range of data linked to physical performance, including red blood cell count and vitamin D and iron levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2016/may/04/blood-testing-for-amateur-runners\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/running\">Running</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fitness\">Fitness</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/athletics\">Athletics</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport\">Sport</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2016 11:31:10 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2016/may/04/blood-testing-for-amateur-runners</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e9d7d0cc396a395410c52f8151798bb7315b99c/0_100_3000_1800/3000.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=9f031f9a5399405028c6f187c85e502c\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e9d7d0cc396a395410c52f8151798bb7315b99c/0_100_3000_1800/3000.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=81879d7b510bfb2bc7a620b9165fd623\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Tom Levitt</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-04T11:31:10Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>How was your weekend running?</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2016/may/02/how-was-your-weekend-running</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever been chased down by a driver in a race? Sounds nightmarish, but it\u2019s what awaits Wings for Life World Run participants. Share your weekend woes and triumphs below the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It feels a bit like cheating, but in the interests of full disclosure, I\u2019m writing this before the weekend. On Saturday, I\u2019m off to Japan \u2013 for a holiday and to do the &lt;a href=\"http://www.wingsforlifeworldrun.com/gb/en/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_term=wings%20for%20life%20world%20run&amp;amp;utm_campaign=\"&gt;Wings for Life World Run&lt;/a&gt;. That being so, I\u2019m tempted to invent a fantasy weekend of running: 5k PB at parkrun on Saturday, 10km PB on Sunday, recovery run Sunday evening sound good? Oh, OK then, I\u2019ll be squeezing in a quick track session on Saturday morning before sitting on a plane for 12 hours and trying not to go out of my mind with boredom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, then, a brief explainer of the Wings for Life run, which doesn\u2019t seem very well known, but which I cannot recommend highly enough. The basic principle is that everyone starts at the same time at the locations around the world, regardless of time zone. A catcher car starts half an hour later, and very gradually speeds up. You are \u201cout\u201d when the car passes you. The result is that, unlike in most races, the fastest people run the longest. When you are \u201ccaught\u201d you head back to HQ to watch the action unfold on a big screen. It\u2019s unlike any other race I\u2019ve done, and the fact that the Japanese edition takes place in the dark in, for me, totally unfamiliar terrain, &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/may/04/how-was-your-weekend-running\"&gt;should make it even more surreal than my experience last year&lt;/a&gt;.

He didn\u2019t just revolutionise his sport \u2013 he reinvented it. He rewrote the record books and redrew the boundaries of endurance, redefining the whole idea of what was humanly possible. No one else, before or since, has dominated distance running in a way that he did in the late 1940s and early 1950s. His &lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/22/50-olympic-stunning-moments-emil-zatopek\"&gt;achievements at the Helsinki Olympics&lt;/a&gt; will never be equalled. And he did all this with a crazy playfulness and generosity of spirit that made him perhaps the most loved Olympian of all time. The only comparable figure I can think of in 20th century sport is Muhammad Ali \u2013 yet Z\u00e1topek, unlike Ali, has barely been touched by biographers until now&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2016/apr/27/today-we-die-a-little-writing-the-story-of-emil-zatopek\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/running\">Running</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fitness\">Fitness</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/czechoslovakia\">Czechoslovakia</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world\">World news</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/athletics\">Athletics</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books\">Books</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sportandleisure\">Sport and leisure</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture\">Culture</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sport\">Sport</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/biography\">Biography</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-general\">Olympics</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 12:01:56 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2016/apr/27/today-we-die-a-little-writing-the-story-of-emil-zatopek</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6f538db8285cbba89003cd976e9645527a9893e/0_78_1968_1181/1968.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a56832d42472c15c3874fab431741bf6\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: -/EPA</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6f538db8285cbba89003cd976e9645527a9893e/0_78_1968_1181/1968.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=6a826d08ddf2a21e632d2abb926de3af\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: -/EPA</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Kate Carter</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-04-27T12:01:56Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Running picture of the day: the Marathons des Sables</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/picture/2016/apr/27/running-picture-of-the-day-the-marathons-des-sables</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;\u2018It\u2019s the end of day two at the 31st edition of Morocco\u2019s &lt;a href=\"http://marathondessables.com/en/\"&gt;Marathon des Sables&lt;/a&gt;.

But is the data clearcut?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spot of gardening, going travelling \u2013 who hasn\u2019t daydreamed about early retirement? So damn the latest study in the &lt;a href=\"http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2016/03/21/jech-2015-207097.short?g=w_jech_ahead_tab\"&gt;Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health&lt;/a&gt; that shows an early retirement can mean less time to enjoy it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might assume the effect was caused by sicker people retiring earlier and dying prematurely, but this study really tries to take that into account. The researchers analysed data from 2,956 people who were part of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/publication/growing-older-america-health-and-retirement-study/preface\"&gt;Healthy Retirement Study&lt;/a&gt; funded by the&lt;a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/\"&gt; National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; in America. People were divided into unhealthy and healthy retirees based on whether they said sickness influenced their decision to stop work: about two-thirds were healthy and a third unhealthy. During the 18 years of the study, 12% of the healthy and 25.6% of the unhealthy group died. After taking into account factors such as the healthy group\u2019s better education and finances, they found that healthy retirees who worked a year longer (over the age of 65) had an 11% lower \u2018all-cause mortality risk\u201d. Even the unhealthy group reduced their likelihood of dying by 9% if they delayed retirement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/02/early-earlier-retirement-retire-death-risk-data-research-jobs\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/retirement-age\">Retirement age</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/work-and-careers\">Work &amp; careers</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/ageing\">Ageing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/science\">Science</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/older-people\">Older people</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/society\">Society</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2016 06:30:16 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/02/early-earlier-retirement-retire-death-risk-data-research-jobs</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc39d7f2aa38d19259fa602e6496da1c0c81fd8b/2184_1511_1874_1124/1874.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=66005e4e579767405c8b2568c18a1dce\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Alamy</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc39d7f2aa38d19259fa602e6496da1c0c81fd8b/2184_1511_1874_1124/1874.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=7e12953ba6c6f6f488cfc53d778edbfa\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Alamy</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Luisa Dillner</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-02T06:30:16Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Will a holiday make me happy \u2013 and if it does, how long will it last?</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/25/will-a-holiday-make-me-happy-and-if-it-does-how-long-will-it-last</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;The experts are unanimous: holidays do you good, and you should take more of them. Here are the pitfalls to avoid \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Who doesn\u2019t love a holiday? Apart from my husband, who thinks we should save the money in case our boiler packs up. But many people live for them \u2013 a time to recover from work and feel less tired and tense. &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11020089\"&gt;A New York study of middle-aged men at high risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt; found that the more vacations they took, the less likely they were to die over a period of nine years. But the reality of a holiday can be different from those adverts showing smiling families on blissful, empty beaches. Do they really make us healthier and happier? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/25/will-a-holiday-make-me-happy-and-if-it-does-how-long-will-it-last\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/travel\">Travel</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 06:30:39 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/25/will-a-holiday-make-me-happy-and-if-it-does-how-long-will-it-last</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff3684ad635eb159929e479b4143f7dfd3f2376b/0_135_5315_3189/5315.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a286ed3a3cf9a98500f3faa5d5ae5294\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Judith Haeusler/Getty Images/Cultura RF</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff3684ad635eb159929e479b4143f7dfd3f2376b/0_135_5315_3189/5315.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=961031427e08e57b71c4727500deff1c\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Judith Haeusler/Getty Images/Cultura RF</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Luisa Dillner</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-04-25T06:30:39Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Are my emotions giving me migraines?</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/18/are-my-emotions-giving-me-migraines</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;Experts say no but many people link their attacks to stress or emotional upset&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to fly, run your own business or climb Everest? Anything is possible with a virtual reality simulator. Immersive experiences have never been such fun. So, who\u2019s up for experiencing a migraine? Cue Excedrin\u2019s migraine trip, your chance to feel as debilitated, disorientated and distressed as someone who really has the condition. Excedrin makes painkillers (hence its interest in this area) and its representation of the flashing lights and blurry, shifting landscape looks accurate.

Stand-up and treadmill desks might seem to be the answer, but is it worth shelling out for one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting is the new smoking \u2013 blamed for increasing the risk of heart disease and cancer, as well as diabetes and obesity. Health guidelines suggest we should spend 150 minutes a week in moderate exercise, but many of us sit down for more than half the working day \u2013 email means we don\u2019t even have to get up to talk to anyone. So it is not surprising that there is a gap in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stand-up, sit-stand and treadmill desks are all the rage. &lt;a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/the-downside-of-treadmill-desks/?_r=0\"&gt;Google and Microsoft have allegedly bought stacks of treadmill desks&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 modified treadmill bases attached to work surfaces. &lt;a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2014/04/test/walk-life-balance\"&gt;The manufacturer of TrekDesk says that a treadmill-desk set at a walking speed&lt;/a&gt; of 1.5km an hour will burn 2.6 calories a minute. Such energy expenditure does not come cheap: desks cost upwards of \u00a31,000. But do they make people more active and healthier, or are they this year\u2019s corporate gimmick?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/28/is-a-stand-up-desk-really-healthier\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2016 07:30:20 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/28/is-a-stand-up-desk-really-healthier</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a36275dfabe88911ab29a11c3dab4cc122c98c4/0_78_4928_2955/master/4928.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=573a0978c032e7a8b1be4a18261e85ae\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a36275dfabe88911ab29a11c3dab4cc122c98c4/0_78_4928_2955/master/4928.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=a48e9a0cf2bd264b886ab7f128d1da20\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Luisa Dillner</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-03-28T07:30:20Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Should men invest  more in friendships?</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/14/are-bromances-good-for-mens-health</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;Research shows that male rats are less stressed if they spend more time together - the same could be true for humans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonding with other guys may relieve stress in men, according to media reports of &lt;a href=\"http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/03/03/bromances-may-be-good-for-mens-health/\"&gt;research published in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/a&gt; last week.

But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessarily better for you &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBJN%2FS0007114515005073a.pdf&amp;amp;code=28b1c09a38f38aa1d4063bbf512011e1\"&gt;After publishing a study showing organic milk has higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; than ordinarily farmed products, Professor Chris Seal braced himself for the backlash. There is nothing like a study highlighting the benefits, or lack thereof, of organic food, to cause a spat. And &lt;a href=\"http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FBJN%2FS0007114516000349a.pdf&amp;amp;code=078dcb0f73b18b519a5cdd4ecca8b84c\"&gt;Seal\u2019s study in the British Journal of Nutrition last week &lt;/a&gt; (alongside another by him on meat that also shows higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids) certainly has its detractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the study was funded by the &lt;a href=\"http://opencharities.org/charities/328369\"&gt;Sheepdrove Trust&lt;/a&gt;, a British charity that supports organic farming, hasn\u2019t helped. Seal says the money paid for analysis only, and that the charity didn\u2019t have any input into the research. The study, a meta-analysis of 196 papers on milk (the other looked at 36 studies on meat), found that organic-grass-fed cows produced milk with 50% more omega-3 fatty acids than that from ordinary dairy cows. These fatty acids are linked to reductions in heart disease. But, while 50% sounds like a lot, full-fat milk is only 4% fat (semi skimmed is 2%) so this translates to an tiny amount more fatty acid in organic milk. Seal argues that if you added in organic cheese and butter, this would increase. But others point out you could get more nutritional benefit buying fruit and vegetables than hoovering up organic dairy produce.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/22/is-organic-food-healthier\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/milk\">Milk</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/organicgardening\">Organic gardening</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/organics\">Organics</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethical-living\">Ethical and green living</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/environment\">Environment</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2016 07:40:54 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/22/is-organic-food-healthier</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/065b697f20ec2fe6f4b6f77a902668729a77e9d7/0_0_6300_3781/master/6300.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=74c592567682922b23d90277ad4ca40d\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Alamy</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/065b697f20ec2fe6f4b6f77a902668729a77e9d7/0_0_6300_3781/master/6300.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=468ef3911dbb4aa369e6d3ba4a8b3215\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Alamy</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Luisa Dillner</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-02-22T07:40:54Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Is it good to be bored (or will it be the death of you)?</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/15/is-it-good-to-be-bored-or-will-it-be-the-death-of-you</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;One study implies that boredom make you likelier to die earlier, but another concludes that it spurs creativity \u2026&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re watching a PowerPoint presentation and it\u2019s slide 10 out of 75.

Meanwhile, UK officials say it should only be done for those at high risk. Who\u2019s right?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone over the age of 18 should be screened for depression, says the &lt;a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2484345\" title=\"\"&gt;US Preventive Services Task Force&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 and the government-appointed body really means everyone. Doctors should ask&amp;nbsp;people if they are sad, tired or distracted \u2013 even if they have come in with an ingrown toenail. The rationale for this is that &lt;a href=\"http://www.webmd.com/depression/news/20100104/americans-with-depression-are-undertreated\" title=\"\"&gt;only half of those in the US&lt;/a&gt; who are depressed get treatment, yet the World Health Organisation projects that by 2020, depression will&amp;nbsp;be the &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4100461/\" title=\"\"&gt;second leading cause of disability worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, for a condition to be screenable, it should be important, common, treatable and the benefits of screening should outweigh the harms. It shouldn\u2019t have high rates of false positives (diagnosing someone without the condition) or false negatives (missing someone who does have it). The task force says screening for depression fulfills these criteria and that &lt;a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cognitive-behavioural-therapy/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" title=\"\"&gt;cognitive behavioural therapy&lt;/a&gt; and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, a type of antidepressant) both reduce symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/08/should-i-be-screened-for-depression\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/depression\">Depression</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/society\">Society</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2016 09:00:13 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/08/should-i-be-screened-for-depression</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ba176e8f77cf6d72eb5d5758b0b1e0638fd18df/0_133_5120_3070/master/5120.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b334612da9b369701bd55cd408cf41d4\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: JGI/Jamie Grill/Getty Images/Blend Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ba176e8f77cf6d72eb5d5758b0b1e0638fd18df/0_133_5120_3070/master/5120.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=2f192a598e472961734bbd8cd62e893c\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: JGI/Jamie Grill/Getty Images/Blend Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Luisa Dillner</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-02-08T09:00:13Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Ask Alanis Morissette: since I\u2019ve been ill, I\u2019ve lost contact with many friends</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/06/ask-alanis-morissette-ill-and-lost-friends</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;All the parts of you \u2013 lonely, confident, ill, outgoing \u2013 come together to make you who you are. A true friend will recognise that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few years ago, I got very ill and I am still suffering the after-effects. I can\u2019t work and now struggle in social situations. I am finding myself incredibly lonely, isolated and depressed. I used to be outgoing and confident, but I have been losing contact with my old friends. I had thought it was because I often turn down invitations due to being unwell, but this week I received a message from one of my oldest friends to tell me that I bring her down and that I need to cheer up. I am heartbroken. I have so much love and friendship to offer, just not in the same way I was able to before. What should I do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, illnesses or injuries or bouts of depression can leave us feeling completely altered. It makes sense to me that your big life adjustment would have an effect on your social life, and I have a lot of empathy for how hard that can be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/06/ask-alanis-morissette-ill-and-lost-friends\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/depression\">Depression</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">Relationships</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/society\">Society</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 15:00:09 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/06/ask-alanis-morissette-ill-and-lost-friends</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f67c45e3ae7763eabcc2c0e56bc6990eb99b901e/57_0_1553_932/1553.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=b352405a7178b5673127627e0ed1b249\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Franck Allais/Franck Allais for the Guardian</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f67c45e3ae7763eabcc2c0e56bc6990eb99b901e/57_0_1553_932/1553.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=7d41b6b9641cd36afe632106e87f1cda\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Franck Allais/Franck Allais for the Guardian</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Alanis Morissette</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-06T15:00:09Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>My son\u2019s girlfriend has anorexia and I worry about the effect on him</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/06/my-sons-girlfriend-has-anorexia-and-i-worry-about-the-effect-on-him</link>\r\n      <description>He seems to be coping but I think he\u2019s too young to deal with this complicated illness alone. Annalisa Barbieri advises a reader&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My adult son is in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend, who has a serious eating disorder. When he first met her she was slim but healthy. Unbeknown to him, she had recently recovered from anorexia. Sadly, over the past few years, the anorexia has returned and she is now extremely frail and underweight. She has recently committed to an inpatient plan but it will be a long process and she is still entrenched in her eating habits and resistant to change, despite having had therapy for almost a year. I am very hopeful that she will be successful, but if she isn\u2019t I worry how this will affect him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know that recovery from anorexia is a long and painful process and inevitably her illness will have a great impact on both their lives. Although her friends and family are supportive, he is the one who sees her every day and has to watch her starve herself, which must be very painful. I don\u2019t often see him on his own and try not to talk about it too much as he seems to prefer to deal with it by pretending it\u2019s not happening and making elaborate travel and holiday plans for the two of them, which seems to me a form of escapism. I suggested he might want therapy or to go to a support group but he says he has a few good friends he can speak to if necessary. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/06/my-sons-girlfriend-has-anorexia-and-i-worry-about-the-effect-on-him\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/family\">Family</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 14:00:28 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/06/my-sons-girlfriend-has-anorexia-and-i-worry-about-the-effect-on-him</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bec1badadb410120042528e37b3d38b10ce0d118/0_129_3944_2367/3944.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=da8c9982f2f643312aaaf0cd70665ead\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: marcoventuriniautieri/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bec1badadb410120042528e37b3d38b10ce0d118/0_129_3944_2367/3944.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=6d4f3861ea15bcc6ec14619eb61cfc6c\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: marcoventuriniautieri/Getty Images</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Annalisa Barbieri</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-06T14:00:28Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>My boyfriend cheated on me but I want to move in | Mariella Frostrup</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/08/my-boyfriend-cheated-on-me-but-i-want-to-move-in-with-him-mariella-frostrup</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;A woman wants more commitment from her boyfriend. The imbalances in their relationship ring alarm bells for Mariella Frostrup&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dilemma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; My boyfriend can\u2019t say \u201cI love you\u201d. He says it will take time. We\u2019ve been going out for a year and a half. For him actions speak louder than words. But he slept with another woman while drunk and travelling six months ago. He was very sorry, and we worked through it and re-established trust and connection. I appreciate his honesty, but at times feel angry. He says that though he felt more lustful passion towards past girlfriends, we have a better chance of staying together because the relationship is not based on superficial unrealistic lust but instead care, fun, respect and growing together. We talk about marriage and babies. I\u2019d like to move in with him, but he\u2019s not ready yet. I\u2019m starting to read this as a sign that he\u2019s not committed to me. Is it normal to have some doubts about a relationship?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mariella replies &lt;/strong&gt;What a catch! Seriously, I\u2019d be having doubts, too. There\u2019s little in your description that suggests to me that he\u2019s in for the long haul. Rationing your allowance when it comes to commitment and desire is hardly the stuff of epic romance. Instead he seems to be doing everything in his power to keep you at arm\u2019s length and in return you\u2019re, what\u2026 grateful? I know a good man is hard to find, or certainly was in my searching days, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should settle for slim pickings from the outset. Relationships in the long term may be all about compromise, but in the short term they should deliver satisfaction and joy, not self-doubt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/08/my-boyfriend-cheated-on-me-but-i-want-to-move-in-with-him-mariella-frostrup\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">Relationships</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Sun, 08 May 2016 08:00:02 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/08/my-boyfriend-cheated-on-me-but-i-want-to-move-in-with-him-mariella-frostrup</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b121a807d01c551ed09af0a4b92e6fb291bbd8b/0_163_4901_2940/4901.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=856b4f748f03cdc9d95f8332383853d4\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Lev Dolgachov / Alamy/Alamy</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b121a807d01c551ed09af0a4b92e6fb291bbd8b/0_163_4901_2940/4901.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0d19426afa89668febb6c17b87f95c71\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Lev Dolgachov / Alamy/Alamy</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Mariella Frostrup</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-08T08:00:02Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>I have come out as gay, but no one seems to want to love me</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/06/come-out-as-gay-no-one-wants-to-love-me</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am torn between my religious upbringing and being out, and am disappointed at the emphasis on sex in gay culture. Why can\u2019t someone see the real loving me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am 26 and I came out as gay at the end of last year. I am from a religious background and I feel stuck between two realms and I can\u2019t find the appropriate balance. Seeking a lasting loving relationship for a 26-year-old virgin is not as easy as I thought. With so much preference for everyone to be physical in gay culture, I feel disappointed and even more alone in a foreign country. Dating websites only add to my sorrow and despair. From the religion side, it seems everyone hates me for who I love. I feel I can\u2019t even go back nor move forward, since it seems I am not worth loving, even though I am a talented, loving, caring individual.

If the moss is unhappy, it will just break down, adding a little more organic matter to the soil; it may or may not look interesting as it does this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally, it may end up being one of those things you endlessly have to explain: \u201cWhat\u2019s that moss doing there in odd piles?\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s my moss experiment.\u201d To be honest, by far the quickest solution would be just to put it on the compost heap, where it will quickly break down once in the dark.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2016/may/07/can-i-replant-moss-under-a-tree-alys-fowler\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardeningadvice\">Gardening advice</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardens\">Gardens</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 10:00:12 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2016/may/07/can-i-replant-moss-under-a-tree-alys-fowler</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94904fa985f9425521efd982008744957f69094d/188_0_5625_3376/5625.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=176700aae6617c53fc23fac73a7e3c37\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Alamy</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94904fa985f9425521efd982008744957f69094d/188_0_5625_3376/5625.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=9fcb209110cf5566b6b06e6b7063eb1c\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Alamy</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Alys Fowler</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-07T10:00:12Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>My wife prefers masturbation to having sex with me</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/my-wife-prefers-masturbation-to-having-sex-with-me</link>\r\n      <description>I feel devastated by her physical rejection of me and have tried to get her to talk about it or go to see a counsellor, but she refuses&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My wife prefers masturbation to sex&amp;nbsp;with me. This is devastating to me&amp;nbsp;and my self esteem. There are always a long list of excuses of why she doesn\u2019t feel like talking about it. She has cheated on me a few times, too, and I have forgiven her but never&amp;nbsp;forgotten. I brought up going to&amp;nbsp;see somebody to talk about it, but she won\u2019t. What should I do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your wife is giving you a great deal of unspoken information, but it is hard for you to take in, probably because it\u2019s&amp;nbsp;painful. There must be specific reasons why you stay in a marriage with someone who not only rejects you&amp;nbsp;sexually, but also allows you to be&amp;nbsp;aware of her alternative sexual choices. If the positives of the relationship outweigh the negatives, then \u2013 like many other people in a similar bind \u2013 you may decide to continue. Plenty of people choose a sexless marriage, which is usually fine&amp;nbsp;if that\u2019s what both partners desire.&amp;nbsp;But others put up with a situation such&amp;nbsp;as yours because, deep&amp;nbsp;down, they do not believe they can ever have&amp;nbsp;a fair and equitable relationship. Think&amp;nbsp;carefully about what you truly want and need. How&amp;nbsp;important is sex to you? How important is having sex with &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; to you? Ask that she respect your perfectly valid and urgent need to talk&amp;nbsp;this through. Given the impasse between you, you have a right to insist&amp;nbsp;on counselling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/my-wife-prefers-masturbation-to-having-sex-with-me\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sex\">Sex</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">Relationships</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2016 07:00:07 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/09/my-wife-prefers-masturbation-to-having-sex-with-me</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e304372a01bf5728c1d180b501088677b8220870/0_245_5700_3420/5700.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=6d3766ec65c655474e2710e9b27cad26\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Image Source/Getty Images/Image Source</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e304372a01bf5728c1d180b501088677b8220870/0_245_5700_3420/5700.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=1e09bcb98d89fbae8fc1170dfb4f6345\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Image Source/Getty Images/Image Source</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Pamela Stephenson Connolly</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-09T07:00:07Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>My job is great \u2013 except for one board member</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/09/my-job-is-great-except-for-one-board-member-dear-jeremy</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every meeting I\u2019ve scheduled with this person has been cancelled, and the only contact is via terse email or critical comments fed back via my line manager&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/series/dearjeremy\"&gt;Dear Jeremy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;advice column in the Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions.

You put all your weight over one leg, then step forwards (or backwards or sideways) with the other, lowering your body and using your legs to propel you back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much does it cost? &lt;/strong&gt;Nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/07/is-it-worth-doing-lunges-exercise-review\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/fitness\">Fitness</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle\">Life and style</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing\">Health &amp; wellbeing</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2016 05:00:05 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/07/is-it-worth-doing-lunges-exercise-review</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbbc813deebaee41c85da1ae7306ee18e80bf083/0_55_657_394/657.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=4dbef3935bb8461815dd39ab959069c0\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Son of Alan for the Guardian</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbbc813deebaee41c85da1ae7306ee18e80bf083/0_55_657_394/657.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=af5f53b1aeb5d95430e2ffa80b6eb68b\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Son of Alan for the Guardian</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Stuart Heritage</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-07T05:00:05Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n    <item>\r\n      <title>Will higher rate stamp duty apply if my ex wants to buy me out?</title>\r\n      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/12/will-higher-rate-stamp-duty-apply-if-my-ex-wants-to-buy-me-out</link>\r\n      <description>&lt;p&gt;Confusion over new rules and how they apply to purchasing full stake in part-owned property is affecting my chances of buying a place of my own&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;I desperately need some advice on the new stamp duty rules. My boyfriend and I split up last year but we own a property together, bought in 2010, which is our primary residence. He has a buy-to-let property which is nothing to do with me (and neither of us have lived there) that he\u2019s owned for 10 years, bought with inheritance from his grandparents. We are currently in the process of him buying me out of my half of our property so that I can buy a place of my own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our solicitors are saying that he will have to pay the higher rate of stamp duty land tax on this purchase, even though he is not buying a new property and this will remain his main residence. This is an increase of \u00a37,000 on the stamp duty he was expecting to pay and he isn\u2019t sure he can afford it, which is putting my house purchase in jeopardy. Everyone seems unsure of what is correct in this situation and we\u2019re both extremely confused. Surely the stamp duty change was to stop people purchasing second homes, not from buying additional interest in the property they already own? Neither of us can quite believe that he will have to pay over \u00a310,000 in stamp duty to purchase half of the house he already owns and lives in. &lt;strong&gt;SS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/12/will-higher-rate-stamp-duty-apply-if-my-ex-wants-to-buy-me-out\"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/property\">Property</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/money\">Money</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/mortgages\">Mortgages</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/buying-to-let\">Buying to let</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/stampduty\">Stamp duty</category>\r\n      <category domain=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/tax\">Tax</category>\r\n      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 06:00:21 GMT</pubDate>\r\n      <guid>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/12/will-higher-rate-stamp-duty-apply-if-my-ex-wants-to-buy-me-out</guid>\r\n      <media:content width=\"140\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f97bb08569dc4d304cfd56342c9a9892e59871b/92_124_3342_2005/3342.jpg?w=140&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=9364446d777968e144e96da2388186a7\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <media:content width=\"460\" url=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f97bb08569dc4d304cfd56342c9a9892e59871b/92_124_3342_2005/3342.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=c41af24499aaf4467aad9eb48f93b12e\">\r\n        <media:credit scheme=\"urn:ebu\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</media:credit>\r\n      </media:content>\r\n      <dc:creator>Virginia Wallis</dc:creator>\r\n      <dc:date>2016-05-12T06:00:21Z</dc:date>\r\n    </item>\r\n  </channel>\r\n</rss>\r\n\r\n",
