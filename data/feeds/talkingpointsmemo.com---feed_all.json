As Donald Trump and the GOP establishment go through this delicate dance toward a marriage of convenience, there are two or three big policy initiatives that are usually referenced as the ones that are just unacceptable to mainstream Republicans, too crazy to be considered, unconstitutional or just too politically damaging. The most frequently mentioned are Trump's proposed ban on Muslims entering the country and the Trump TajMaWall he says Mexico will agree to pay for.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This strikes me as odd because despite how odious these ideas are, there's very little mention of what is undoubtedly the craziest, most dangerous, most expensive and brutal of his policies: his plan to deport roughly 3% of the current US population in 18 months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/what-about-the-mass-expulsion\" class=\"read-more\"&gt;Read More&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n    <author>\n      <name>Josh Marshall</name>\n    </author>\n    <meta published=\"1463085780\" updated=\"1463085955\" permalink=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/what-about-the-mass-expulsion\" image=\"http://a4.img.talkingpointsmemo.com/image/upload/c_fill,fl_keep_iptc,g_faces,h_365,w_652/bzktolu2d9dz2zawjhfg.jpg\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>249630</id>\n    <published>2016-05-12T16:41:14-04:00</published>\n    <updated>2016-05-12T16:41:14-04:00</updated>\n    <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/facebook-explains-trending-news-curation-amid-backlash\"/>\n    <title>Facebook Explains Its Trending News Curation Amid Leaks, Allegations Of Bias</title>\n    <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Facebook &lt;a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/05/information-about-trending-topics/\"&gt;clarified its policies&lt;/a&gt; for choosing trending news topics on Thursday, following a rough week for the company that began with backlash to a &lt;a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/gizmodo-reports-facebook-suppresses-conservative-news\"&gt;report &lt;/a&gt;alleging the social network's \"news curators\" suppressed conservative news.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/facebook-explains-trending-news-curation-amid-backlash\" class=\"read-more\"&gt;Read More&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n    <author>\n      <name>Kristin Salaky</name>\n    </author>\n    <meta published=\"1463085674\" updated=\"1463085674\" permalink=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/facebook-explains-trending-news-curation-amid-backlash\" image=\"http://a1.img.talkingpointsmemo.com/image/upload/c_fill,fl_keep_iptc,g_faces,h_365,w_652/uzfnyhvufqrlhhgddede.jpg\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>249632</id>\n    <published>2016-05-12T16:24:58-04:00</published>\n    <updated>2016-05-12T16:24:58-04:00</updated>\n    <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/feds-wont-withhold-funding-north-carolina-hb2\"/>\n    <title>Obama Admin Won\u2019t Withhold Funds From North Carolina Over Anti-LGBT Law</title>\n    <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;The White House said Thursday that it doesn't plan to withhold federal funding from North Carolina while the state and the Justice Department fight a legal battle over an anti-LGBT law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/feds-wont-withhold-funding-north-carolina-hb2\" class=\"read-more\"&gt;Read More&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&lt;/a&gt;</content>\n    <author>\n      <name>Allegra Kirkland</name>\n    </author>\n    <meta published=\"1463084698\" updated=\"1463084698\" permalink=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/feds-wont-withhold-funding-north-carolina-hb2\" image=\"http://a1.img.talkingpointsmemo.com/image/upload/c_fill,fl_keep_iptc,g_faces,h_365,w_652/dagvhh7do6wfamjaijka.jpg\"/>\n  </entry>\n  <entry>\n    <id>249626</id>\n    <published>2016-05-12T15:50:32-04:00</published>\n    <updated>2016-05-12T15:50:32-04:00</updated>\n    <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/donald-trump-gop-senators-meeting\"/>\n    <title>GOP Senators Swoon Over Donald Trump After Hill Meeting</title>\n    <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;After Donald Trump's much-ballyhooed trip Thursday to Capitol Hill, some Republican senators present in his meeting with GOP Senate leadership praised him for his willingness to \"listen\" behind closed doors.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"He was like I've always known: very straightforward ... very open about what he believes, very cordial,\" Sen.

Rubio walked away, turned, smiled and said, \"June 24.\"&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;His office said Rubio's plans for 2017 are still unchanged and that he was making the comment in jest. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;\"It was a joke.

But remember, the House is heavily gerrymandered. It may be plausible that a total blowout at the top of the ticket could lose Republicans the House. But it's not likely.
