This time, Tommy Paxton-Beesley, a.k.a. River Tiber,\u00a0talks Toronto, inspiration, and his debut album.</h6>\n<hr />\n<p>Tommy Paxton-Beesley, a.k.a <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/rivertiber\" target=\"_blank\">River Tiber</a>, has been grinding it out in the Toronto underground for a few years now and it's about to pay off. His ethereal take on R&amp;B\u00a0incorporates the cold, rigid style of modern digital production\u00a0while still maintaining a warm tone, communicated through smooth layers of live instrumentation. Guitars,\u00a0strings, live drums, horns, and synthesizers find a home\u00a0in his music, played entirely by the Toronto native himself.</p>\n<p>Since the release of his debut EP,\u00a0<em><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/rivertiber/the-star-falls-1?in=rivertiber/sets/the-star-falls-ep\" target=\"_blank\">The Star Falls</a>,\u00a0</em>in 2013, River Tiber's name\u00a0has been gaining notoriety. \"No Talk,\" a track\u00a0from his late-2015\u00a0EP\u00a0<em>When The Time Is Right,\u00a0</em>got a big time nod from the OVO camp when his vocals were sampled for <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/drake\" target=\"_blank\">Drake</a>'s <a href=\"https://play.spotify.com/track/2xpoTj7AeSFVuvD0ibD3Pg\" target=\"_blank\">\"No Tellin'.\"</a> A look from the 6 God obviously gained him a bit of buzz, but he's been working hard and collaborating with other notable artists to keep the momentum going.</p>\n<p>He worked closely with <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/badbadnotgood\" target=\"_blank\">BADBADNOTGOOD</a> during the recording of\u00a0their collaborative album with <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/ghostface_killah/\" target=\"_blank\">Ghostface Killah</a>,\u00a0<em>Sour Soul.\u00a0</em>He snagged a few feature spots on <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/kaytranada\" target=\"_blank\">Kaytranada</a>'s fantastic new album <em>99.9%</em>. He's recorded with Toronto's hip-hip prince <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/Jazz-Cartier\" target=\"_blank\">Jazz Cartier</a> for a track on his latest project\u00a0<em>Hotel Paranoia,</em>\u00a0and recently dropped a song with <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/pusha-t\" target=\"_blank\">Pusha T</a>.<em>\u00a0</em>As his name begins pops up more frequently, you get the sense that he's not going away any time soon.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://embed.itunes.apple.com/us/embedded-player/idsa.40518c21-185d-11e6-b852-dfff4f5db17e\" width=\"100%\" height=\"104\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>With the release of a new single (above) comes news of\u00a0River Tiber's impending\u00a0debut album <em>Indigo</em>. Mark your calendar, it arrives on June\u00a024. I spoke with River Tiber this week to get a sense of what he's\u00a0been doing, what's inspiring him, and what to expect on his debut.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Chart Attack: You've been making music for while, haven't you? You're formally trained?</strong></p>\n<p><div class=\"post_pull_left\"><div class=\"post_quote\"><div id=\"post_quote_logo\"><img src=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/themes/chartattack/images/quote.svg\" width=\"30\" height=\"26\"></div><div id=\"post_quote_text\"><p>There's some nights where, like, the whole Toronto music scene will be in one building.</p></div><div style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: -30px\"><small>River Tiber</small></div></div></div><strong>River Tiber:\u00a0</strong>Yeah. I started with cello lessons when I was a kid. I just liked the cello, and I went to this community music school called St. Christopher House in Toronto. That's how I got into music.</p>\n<p><strong>When did you go from being a student to\u00a0pursuing a career as River Tiber?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>River Tiber started to form late in 2010. I played in bands through middle school and high school, so it was always kind of forming through my whole life, really, but in the past five years I started to take it really seriously.</p>\n<p><strong>What made you choose to go the solo route if you were playing in bands?</strong></p>\n<p>I mean, I was always kind of doing both. I was sort of producing music at that age without fully realizing that it was production. The role of a producer is sometimes pretty mysterious, you know? So I didn't even really know that I was being a producer. I picked up various instruments over the years and I always kind of envisioned myself creating this music that I was hearing in my head. I still collaborate a ton, collaboration is a super important part of what I do, but there's just certain stuff that's so personal to me that I have to make it by myself.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/253872827&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of collaboration, you just worked with Pusha T. That was a huge record. How'd that come about?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>That was crazy, man. It was put together as part of Red Bull Sound Select. They help put together these collabs with more established artists. Kay is my boy. I was at Red Bull Music Academy in Paris when the attacks happened, so it got cancelled. So I flew back to LA, which is where I was coming from because I had played a show at 30 Days in LA, which is a Red Bull thing. It was a crazy time and I just wanted to make the most of it, so I was like, can we try and make some sessions happen? It happened really fast.</p>\n<div class=\"related-post\"><div class=\"related-post-shortcode-heading-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"related-post-shortcode-heading\">RELATED</h2>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #1c1c1c; margin-bottom: 20px\"></div><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/features/2015/06/11/four-young-canadian-bedroom-producers-you-need-to-know/\"><div class=\"related-post-shortcode-row\"><img src=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4-Young-Canadian-Bedroom-Producers-You-Need-To-Know-300x169.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"4 Young Canadian Bedroom Producers You Need To Know\"><h4>4 young Canadian bedroom producers you need to know</h4></div>\n\t\t\t</a></div>\n<p><strong>You're on Kaytranada's new album, you've been working with <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/daniel-caesar/\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel\u00a0Caesar</a>. It seems like you've been big on collaborations lately. Are you in an \"I just want to work with everybody\" mindset?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, well, I mean, it's simultaneous. I've put out a bunch of music where I did everything on it, you know, and I'm going to continue to do that too, but sometimes you've just got to come out of your shell. Collaboration can be so rewarding, and it helps me to find my voice. It's so rewarding to let go sometimes.</p>\n<p><strong>To let go\u00a0of the control?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, exactly, and just, like, let other voices in. I think also I've come at it from the other angle. When I worked with BADBADNOTGOOD\u00a0on their albums, their third album and\u00a0<em>Sour Soul,\u00a0</em>that was the collab where it was me as the guest and I was coming in from the other angle and trying to support their vision. I've learned from those experiences and from collaborating in other different ways. I've really grown from all of that, so right now I'm definitely trying to work in that capacity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/features/2016/05/12/uncharted-river-tiber/\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WRYl7J31rrg/maxresdefault.jpg\" alt=\"YouTube Video\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Are you one of those artists who draws a lot of inspiration from being around other artists?</strong></p>\n<p><div class=\"post_pull_left\"><div class=\"post_quote\"><div id=\"post_quote_logo\"><img src=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/themes/chartattack/images/quote.svg\" width=\"30\" height=\"26\"></div><div id=\"post_quote_text\"><p>It's like Toronto versus everybody. When anybody succeeds it lifts the whole community up, honestly.</p></div><div style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: -30px\"><small>River Tiber</small></div></div></div>Yeah, definitely, definitely. I learned a lot from working with <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/frank-dukes/\" target=\"_blank\">Frank Dukes</a>, for sure, and BADBAD. Everybody just has a completely different journey and story and sound, and also, I mean, on a technical level, when you work with other producers or artists everybody's got totally different ways of doing this stuff. There's nothing formal about it. We just make it up ourselves and figure out how to do this shit by just listening to records and kind of trying to guess as to how shit was done, so, you know, you just learn so much by sharing all that shit with each other.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of\u00a0BADBADNOTGOOD and other Toronto artists like Daniel\u00a0</strong><b>Caesar, it seems like there's kind of a new wave of young artists in Toronto who are getting\u00a0things going. Do you feel confident in the way that Toronto's heading right now in terms of music?\u00a0</b></p>\n<p>Yeah, man, there's a crazy scene that hasn't gotten its shine yet. There's a scene that's just bubbling below the surface, but I think that there's a few artists that are about to go far. Like Daniel Caesar. I don't know how long it will take, but I just know that we have a really tight community here. It's kind of crazy how everybody knows each other, you know?</p>\n<p><strong>Yeah, it seems like you guys all work pretty close, or at least are in communication.</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, we all hang out. There's some nights where, like, the whole Toronto music scene will be in one building.\u00a0It's tight knit. We all know each other and we all fuck with each other, for sure. Everybody's trying to do their own thing still, but yeah.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/144120145&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Would you say there's some\u00a0competition there?</strong></p>\n<p>Oh yeah, definitely, but it's dope though. We all push each other. Also, I think that there's a pretty common understanding that when any one of us succeeds, like... Toronto, we're the underdog in general. It's like Toronto versus everybody. When anybody succeeds it lifts the whole community up, honestly.</p>\n<p><strong>When it's time to lock in and do a project, do you need to isolate yourself at all? Or do you have people coming by and\u00a0giving insight or just hanging out?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>It definitely depends. Sometimes I can feel a little bit protective of stuff that we're working on, but, I don't know, I think that most people understand the threshold between just hearing some shit and giving feedback versus actually like, getting involved in being another producer on some shit, you know what I mean? Like, actually joining in on the collab. I think that there's a sort of unwritten code on how collaboration works.</p>\n<p><strong>The\u00a0reason I asked is because I've seen pictures of your studio with the neon River Tiber sign. It looks like you're trying to create some kind of mood in your workspace.\u00a0I was wondering if you need to put yourself in a certain mindset.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, I definitely need the vibes. <em>Need</em> the vibes. That's super important, to be able to channel by influences. Visual stuff is super important for me, you know, and space, all of it is connected to the music. It's really hard to get inspired in some of the studios where there's just no vibe.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-version=\"6\">\n<div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 50% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\"></div>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/x7JCupE-OR/\" target=\"_blank\">A photo posted by @rivertiber</a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2015-01-16T17:59:32+00:00\">Jan 16, 2015 at 9:59am PST</time></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p><script src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\" async=\"\" defer=\"defer\"></script></p>\n<p><strong>If someone's going into your workspace, what kind of stuff can they expect to find?</strong></p>\n<p>I like to put a lot of pictures of artists that inspire me on the walls. Artists as well, and photographers. I keep a lot of art all over the place. Also, the instruments are super key. I definitely like using old gear that feels like it has a story to it and has character to it. Every piece of instrumentation or gear or whatever that I have has to have character. Everything contributes to the vibe and the output. I just like to create potential with everything, every object in the studio.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you use a lot of analogue gear?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>I do, yeah. The centre of my studio is my Juno 106. That's just like the workstation for the sounds. I also use a lot of live instrumentation, a lot of guitars, lots of live drums and strings, horns, all kinds of shit.</p>\n<div class=\"related-post\"><div class=\"related-post-shortcode-heading-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"related-post-shortcode-heading\">RELATED</h2>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #1c1c1c; margin-bottom: 20px\"></div><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/features/2016/04/07/canadian-musicians-secrets-to-their-sounds/\"><div class=\"related-post-shortcode-row\"><img src=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/5-Canadian-musicians-reveal-the-one-piece-of-gear-that-defines-their-sound-300x169.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"5 Canadian musicians reveal the one piece of gear that defines their sound\"><h4>5 Canadian musicians reveal the one piece of gear that defines their sound</h4></div>\n\t\t\t</a></div>\n<p><strong>That's what I like about your music.

You only need a laptop with Fruity Loops, Ableton or Logic on it to be able to create. That's super dope.

I've been mixing the album for a while, so it's a particular chapter in my musical development. I'm kind of on to the next one already, but that's how it goes. It takes a while to finish a body of work. In the meantime things are getting finished, because there's a lot of technical processes in getting it to the level of release. I'm fully in the next chapter right now so it's kind of crazy to put out shit that way, but that's always how it is.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/257722300&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>How far back does the music go? Is it a combination of old and new, or is it a more recent development?\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Some of it goes back two or three years as far as pieces that I've written. I'm always writing, and pieces of that will develop over time and change forms and shit, but then other things are more recent. Sometimes it will just be one of those nights and I'll just start and finish the majority of a song in just a few hours and it's just got that spontaneous energy. It's kind of a mixture of those two things, things that have been developed over time and others that are that spontaneous energy.</p>\n<p><strong>So it must feel a bit like you're\u00a0living one step behind where you're actually at.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>Of course, yeah. But the album, I'm super proud of it. I've been living with it for a while, over a year actually, maybe even longer than that. Sometimes you'll make some shit and want to put it out right away, but it feels good to live with it for a while, let it ferment a little bit, and see how it lives with you as your perspective changes. The album has stood my own test of time.\u00a0I mean, it's truth to me.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/features/2016/05/12/uncharted-river-tiber/\">UNCHARTED: It&#8217;s River Tiber&#8217;s turn</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/author/adam/\">Adam Pugsley</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com\">Chart Attack</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.chartattack.com/features/2016/05/12/uncharted-river-tiber/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>0</slash:comments>\n\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Announcing the free day party lineup for Toronto&#8217;s NO FEST</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.chartattack.com/news/2016/05/12/announcing-free-day-party-lineup-torontos-no-fest/</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.chartattack.com/news/2016/05/12/announcing-free-day-party-lineup-torontos-no-fest/#respond</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2016 17:00:16 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Richard Trapunski]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[NEW(S)]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[UPDATES]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Casper Skulls]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[No Fest]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Pet Sun]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Pony]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.chartattack.com/?p=174594</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Buzz Records' June 18 event will be a chill afternoon of beer, psych, and punk from Casper Skulls, Pet Sun, and Pony.</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/news/2016/05/12/announcing-free-day-party-lineup-torontos-no-fest/\">Announcing the free day party lineup for Toronto&#8217;s NO FEST</a> by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/author/richard/\">Richard Trapunski</a> | <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com\">Chart Attack</a>.</p>\n]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past few years, the festival landscape <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/features/2015/09/25/toronto-summer-festivals-ranked/\" target=\"_blank\">has exploded in Toronto</a> and now <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/news/2016/05/11/canadian-music-festivals-bubble-bursting/\" target=\"_blank\">the bubble is starting to burst</a>.

It's two days at a venue with a day party and then an aftershow at an apartment. But our intentions are,\u00a0and have always been, to foster the development of local music in the city. And then our intentions with NO FEST are to try to put <em>that</em> on the stage rather than any high ticket valued artist outside of Canada or outside of Toronto.</p>\n<p>I mean, that's something that should definitely always be involved, really interesting artists from outside of the country that people want to see. They still are part of the dialogue.\u00a0But, if you have this huge wealth of talent in this city, why not put <em>that</em> on a pedestal?\u00a0Let's focus on what's in front of us. And so that's the ethos I want to build on for this festival. It's: these are bands in the city that you probably don't know, or that you do know, that are deserving of your attention.</p>\n<p><strong>It's hard to ignore that the festival is happening the same weekend as\u00a0NXNE.\u00a0And in the last few years, the local scene seems to be <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/features/2015/06/23/how-many-petitions-will-it-take-to-fix-nxne/\" target=\"_blank\">souring on that festival</a>. I've heard some chatter that \"well, somebody should throw an anti-festival.\"</strong></p>\n<p>I think there were a couple anti-NXNE\u00a0startups, like <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/features/2014/06/17/nxne-losing-touch-toronto-music-scene/\" target=\"_blank\">the year of the radius clause</a>. But that was never our intention.</p>\n<p>We <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/features/2016/03/08/so-whats-up-with-nxne/\" target=\"_blank\">weren't sure if NXNE\u00a0was even going to happen this year</a>, so when we were booking it at that time we were like well, we don't know, because every staff member there we knew, all the programmers I knew, everyone was\u00a0just gone. I don't really know what happened internally there, but it just.. changed. They put together something, so that's great. But at the time it was like \"well, what are we gonna do? This is probably not going to happen.\"</p>\n<p>We'd been working with them for the last four years, and we'd still\u00a0love to be a part of it in the same way we were, but we couldn't\u00a0just all sit around and wait for this festival. We knew we'd still love to something at that time, so we said,\u00a0\"okay, let's just do it at that time.\" And then eventually we realized, oh, NXNE\u00a0is still happening, and there were some\u00a0issues because of that.</p>\n<div class=\"related-post\"><div class=\"related-post-shortcode-heading-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"related-post-shortcode-heading\">RELATED</h2>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #1c1c1c; margin-bottom: 20px\"></div><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/news/2016/04/27/nxne-port-lands/\"><div class=\"related-post-shortcode-row\"><img src=\"http://www.chartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/nxne_fatherjohnmisty2-300x169.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive\" alt=\"nxne port lands\"><h4>So this is what&#8217;s going on with NXNE</h4></div>\n\t\t\t</a></div>\n<p>When I moved to Toronto\u00a0years ago, NXNE really engaged me with music in the city. They\u00a0were able to incorporate the community in the festival. One of my first festival shows was with NorthBy. And it was not a great show, but it I got to be a part of it and it was really fun and it made me excited. I feel like over the years that has slowly kind of gone away, and we want to put that back into a festival.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3780813636/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://ponyband.bandcamp.com/album/crushed\">CRUSHED by PONY</a></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>How has your experience working with NXNE and other festivals in Toronto informed this?</strong></p>\n<p>If you want to get down to brass tacks, I'm sure the purchasing is very similar for headliners and stuff like that. But yeah, I want to take bands who are local and up-and-coming and make\u00a0that what attracts people the festival rather than having huge bands attract people to the festival and then the local community be\u00a0sort of a footnote. In my ideal scenario, you know, five, ten years down the road, this will be a festival people will go to just to see new bands, not to just go see a headliner. It will be, \"oh, I've been to this, I don't know any of the bands, but trust me it'll be good.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Toronto has about a thousand new festivals now. Do you feel you have to do something totally different?</strong></p>\n<p>Not necessarily. For us it's less about looking at what other festivals are and aren't doing and more about what we want to do and bring to the table. A lot of those other festivals are just mega-festivals. Like <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/wayhome-festival/\" target=\"_blank\">WayHome</a> festival, I'm not going to pretend like I can even compete or do something close. I just, I feel there is a gap for what we're trying to focus on. As much as we are small I feel like there's a way to make it big, but with those sort of intentions in mind.</p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=167183712/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" seamless=\"\"><a href=\"http://petsun.bandcamp.com/album/pet-sun\">Pet Sun by Pet Sun</a></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>NO FEST seems to reflect Buzz Records, too. It's like, this is a thing for you and your friends, but it's big enough that other people would want to come and they're invited to come.\u00a0</strong></p>\n<p>[Laughs]\u00a0I hope so. I want everybody to be friends.</p>\n<p>It's weird, the music community, when you think about it, seems like it must be\u00a0a huge monster of a thing. And a lot of the time it's like we all kind of know each other, especially people like us where we're not working for Pepsi, we're working for grassroots organizations that are trying to support and develop artists. Because we're all working towards those goals, yeah, we're all friends. And I feel like this can be a festival for everybody. And, yeah, I want it to come off as like a two day hang where people are just having fun and listening to bands that are good and are right at their doorstep.</p>\n<p>I want it be friendly and\u00a0I want it to be cheap, I want there to be free portions, I want it to be accessible for people, ideally I'd like to put in an all-ages portion in a way that makes sense. I don't want festivals to be these\u00a0out of touch, huge, expensive, fashiony experiences that are exclusive to those who can just afford it or participate. I don't want it to be pretentious. Just have fun, watch some good bands, chill out,. There's something going on at this apartment after, come by if you want.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>DAY 1</strong><br />\n<strong> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chastitybeltmusic/\"

He's spent the past two years mostly behind the board, whether it be with his electro-industrial band <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/blanka\" target=\"_blank\">Blanka</a>\u00a0(one of our <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/features/2016/05/09/cmw-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">favourite CMW surprises</a>) or working with other acts\u00a0like garage pop songwriter\u00a0<a href=\"https://jonvarley.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Varley</a>. B.H.C.\u00a0gives him the freedom to experiment outside of a group setting. Think of <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/brian_eno\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Eno</a>'s solo work vs. his work with <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/david_bowie\" target=\"_blank\">David Bowie</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/talking_heads\" target=\"_blank\">Talking Heads</a>.</p>\n<p>Cloghesy's latest,\u00a0<em>Brave World</em>, is a conceptual piece, he says, making themes of\u00a0militarization, personal trauma, the subconscious, and \"an unavoidably dystopian future.\"\u00a0It was made in the winter, when he was struck by\u00a0that post-university ennui. It was an unstable time, psychologically speaking. And it's reflected by the recording: all chilly environments, skeletal rhythms and anxious, wiry guitar.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/165619156\" width=\"100%\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Premiering on Chart Attack today, B.H.C. and director\u00a0<a href=\"http://isabelleanderson.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Isabelle Anderson</a> present the\u00a0<em>Brave World</em> visual album, collaging archival footage from the US Air Force Academy. It lends concrete representation to the album's emotional abstractions, be they\u00a0pain or fear or hope.</p>\n<p>\"I like [how it portrays] an initial glorification of the military and then the actuality of war,\" Anderson says, \"the men behind the creation and the men involved in the action.

A friend, family member, or coworker could be going through something you're completely unaware of. But just because you don't know doesn't mean you can't help. Treat everyone with love and respect, check in with people you haven't talked to in a while, or say hi to your co-worker at the coffee machine.

He suffers from manic depression. He's devastatingly learned the first and second hand effects of mental illness, having lost a few friends to it.

Plays Itself\"</a> available only when Uber prices surge in Los Angeles. But this one just feels icky.</p>\n<p>Jona Bechtolt and Claire Evans, the real life couple behind YACHT say that someone hacked their property and leaked their sex tape, but the evidence suggests they've invented or embellished\u00a0the story for publicity. If that's the case, they're making light of <a href=\"http://elitedaily.com/women/4chan-nude-photo-leak-scandal/735931/\" target=\"_blank\">what many would call a sex crime</a>.\u00a0One in which most victims don't have the status or platform to, as the band says, \"[control] how the video is seen, and who profits from it.\"</p>\n<p>Let's review: on Monday, the band made a Facebook post explaining that \"due to a series of technological missteps and one morally abject person, a video that we made privately has been released to the public.\" Bechtolt and Evans say they feared the hacked sex tape would circulate. They asked that fans \"make the right decision\" and \"choose not to view a private act that was inadvertently made public.\" They were seeking legal action against the uploader, they said.</p>\n<div class=\"fb-post\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/yacht/posts/10153803801972479\" data-width=\"100%\"></div>\n<p>There was an outpouring of support from fans. Then, a few hours later, the band followed with a second message (a long comment on the first post): they'd been looking into other such sex tapes leaks and have decided to \"be 'as YACHT as possible' about it and take some kind of ownership over what has happened.\" For those who absolutely had to see the video, they'd distribute the clip themselves from a <a href=\"https://fuck.teamyacht.com/\" target=\"_blank\">private website</a> for $5, asking interested parties to choose this slightly more ethical route instead of turning to torrents or tube sites.</p>\n<p>\"Controlling how this video is seen, and who profits from it, is the only form of agency we have left over this exploitative situation,\" they wrote.</p>\n<p>The support roared even louder. The website servers crashed from the surge. News outlets around the world reported the story as fact. But something seemed fishy. <a href=\"https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/yacht-leaked-sex-tape-fake-hoax-trolling\" target=\"_blank\">As <em>Thump</em> points out</a>, there are inconsistencies between the two posts. How could their friend who so graciously helped build\u00a0the website create the thing \"last night\" when they'd only learned about the leak that day? Also, if they\u00a0were aiming to suppress the tape's circulation, why include the uber-titillating:\u00a0\"Our tastes in the bedroom might seem uncommon to some, and possibly off-putting\"?</p>\n<p><em>Thump</em> went a step further and tried to purchase the supposed\u00a0sex tape. For journalism. Upon checkout, they got a server error page. Their credit card was never charged.\u00a0Sleuths, pervs, and other curious sorts across Reddit and 4chan similarly reported the error. No such video existed on any of the large\u00a0torrent or tube sites either. The only people who'd claimed to have seen the video \u2014 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Miranda_July/status/729765022549729280\" target=\"_blank\">Miranda July</a>\u00a0and\u00a0Nicholas Thorburn of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/islands\" target=\"_blank\">Islands</a> \u2014 were friends of the band.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">good for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YACHT\">@yacht</a> for reclaiming their leaked sex tape and making the moist out of it! <a href=\"https://t.co/5i7OSrBiTd\">pic.twitter.com/5i7OSrBiTd</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; nick from islands (@NickfromIslands) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickfromIslands/status/729757653392560128\">May 9, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Rumour spread that this was all a stunt to publicize the release of a music video for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-6FvxPnVm0\" target=\"_blank\">\"I Wanna Fuck You Til I'm Dead\"</a> off their last album, <em>I Thought The Future Would Be Cooler</em>.\u00a0\u00a0<em><a href=\"http://jezebel.com/band-sells-their-own-sex-tape-for-5-after-they-say-som-1775616762\" target=\"_blank\">Jezebel\u00a0</a></em><a href=\"http://jezebel.com/band-sells-their-own-sex-tape-for-5-after-they-say-som-1775616762\" target=\"_blank\">has since\u00a0updated their story</a>, their sources say it's a hoax to promote a single to be released today.</p>\n<p>So is this a comment on clickbait web writing? A criticism of the music marketplace where an artist might conceivably sell a sex tape to offset declining\u00a0record revenue? Or an effective but insensitive ill-conceived promotional campaign that exploits \u2014 by pretending to seriously address \u2014 the very real issues of hacked property and revenge porn?</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE #2</strong></p>\n<p>The band has released a statement, hosted at (yup)\u00a0<a href=\"https://fuck.teamyacht.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fuck.teamyacht.com</a>. Read it in full below:</p>\n<p><strong>TUESDAY, MAY 10TH 2016</strong></p>\n<p>Our sex tape is now viewable on <a href=\"http://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph573173387e4f1\">PornHub</a> and being seeded on <a href=\"https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/14584153/YACHT_Sex_Tape_(2016)\">The Pirate Bay</a>.</p>\n<p>We created a story that was quickly revealed as fiction by the internet. We expected interest, skepticism, and laughter. We didn\u2019t anticipate the outpouring of genuine support, due partially to the credulity with which this story was so extensively and immediately reported.</p>\n<p>We did make a \u201csex tape,\u201d and we want you to watch it. We released it as a slowly-unveiling conspiracy, inspired in equal part by <em>The X-Files</em>, <em>Nathan for You</em>, and <em>The KLF</em>. It\u2019s a project that allowed us to play with science fiction, the attention economy, clickbait journalism, and celebrity sex tapes all at once.</p>\n<p>If you tried to purchase the video here, your card was never charged. This was not designed to make money or sell records, but to explore the intersection of privacy, media, and celebrity. We enjoy and have spent a decade creating multi-faceted projects that unfold over time, using the most current tools at our disposal.</p>\n<p>There is one dark note we want to address. We never make light of victims of any form of sexual abuse. Frankly, it\u2019s disturbing to us that press outlets could make the incredibly irresponsible leap from \u201ccelebrity sex tape,\u201d which is the cultural trope this project explicitly references, to \u201crevenge porn,\u201d which is unfunny, disgusting, morally repugnant, and completely unrelated. Even within the fictional narrative we created, there was no violence or exploitation. It was always about agency and proactive empowerment.</p>\n<p>We couldn\u2019t have asked for better fans, and we realize we\u2019ll need to try much harder to fool you. We will continue to work very hard to produce work that engages and responds to you.</p>\n<p>Love,<br />\nClaire &amp; Jona</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE #3</strong></p>\n<p>YACHT has released another apology, this time with a link to the completed music video that this was supposed to lead up to.

Photo by: Anders Marshall</h6>\n<p>We'll be honest: <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/cmw/\" target=\"_blank\">CMW</a> has always been the bridesmaid of\u00a0Toronto's two rival club-hopping festivals, more of an industry conference with a music component than vice versa. But this year, with <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/features/2016/03/08/so-whats-up-with-nxne/\" target=\"_blank\">NXNE mutating into whatever it is that it's mutating into</a>, CMW is kind of the only game in town.</p>\n<p>So in the interest of proving (to ourselves?) that putting on a wristband and jumping from venue to venue is still a prime festival\u00a0experience, we made it to a lot of CMW sets. And some CMW-partnered <a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/features/hot-docs/\" target=\"_blank\">Hot Docs screenings</a>. And we saw quite a few things we liked! We're sticking to our original plan of putting these in order of what we enjoyed most to least, but this method comes with a couple of caveats:</p>\n<p>First, a lot of stuff that we enjoyed a lot\u00a0(like, say, Keita Juma) falls towards the middle. Second, there's some confirmation bias. For all the pleasant surprises we caught here, there's still a huge mushy middle of mediocrity. We just largely picked the stuff we wanted to see.</p>\n<p>So, what you see here are mostly favourites and a few big duds. Keep it in mind as you scroll,\u00a0but stay open to some discoveries. After all, that's what this should be all about.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"http://www.chartattack.com/tag/skepta\" target=\"_blank\">Skepta</a> @ The Danforth Music Hall, Friday, May 6</h4>\n<p>Walking out on stage in a black trench coat and an obligatory OVO cap, Skepta looked calm and focused in front of the sold out Danforth Music Hall. DJ Maximum cut on\u00a0the\u00a0title track from\u00a0<em>Konnichiwa</em>,<em>\u00a0</em>and the\u00a0energy in the crowd began to boil. As the first lines left the London MC's mouth, the place finally exploded into one giant most pit, a sweaty, chaotic sea of people pulsating up and down for the duration of the song and every one after.</p>\n<p>At one point, some dude in front of me, just having caught a shoulder to the face, tried to stop flow of blood that ran from his nose,\u00a0still smiling and trying to dance as beer cans and water bottles flew through the air above.
