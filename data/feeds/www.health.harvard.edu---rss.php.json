But as it turns out, the effect of physical activity on human physiology may be a lot more complicated than that.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)01577-8\">report</a> recently published in <em>Current Biology</em>, researchers explored the relationship between exercise and \u201cenergy expenditure\u201d (calories burned). This study monitored the physical activity and corresponding total energy expenditure in 322 men and women in North America and Africa.</p>\n<p>What the researchers found was a little surprising. Physical activity did increase energy expenditure as expected, but <em>only up to a point</em>. Physical activity was monitored by accelerometers, which measure counts (units of \u201cmotion\u201d) per minute per day, taking into account motion and velocity. At lower levels of activity, increasing the counts per minute per day did increase energy expenditure. However, with higher mean counts per minute per day, increasing counts did not increase energy expenditure, indicating a ceiling effect. So in this study, after a certain point, more exercise <em>did not</em> equal more energy used.</p>\n<p>Based on their findings, the study investigators encourage that we reconsider current public health messages that state more exercise equals more energy expended, as this is not always the case.</p>\n<p>These study results notwithstanding, whether you\u2019ve yet to get in gear on your New Year\u2019s exercise resolutions or you&#8217;re already an inveterate exerciser, it\u2019s important to know that the benefits of regular physical activity go beyond burning calories. For example, 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity per week can significantly decrease the risk of dying prematurely. How? By lowering blood pressure and resting heart rate, and increasing nitric oxide levels, which serves to open up blood vessels. It also increases levels of beneficial HDL cholesterol and lowers levels of damaging LDL cholesterol. In addition, regular physical activity increases insulin sensitivity. This is especially important for people with diabetes \u2014 and it can also help you avoid the disease in the first place.</p>\n<p>Exercise can also help enhance our cognitive skills \u2014 it&#8217;s true that what is good for the heart is good for the brain. Research demonstrates that regular exercise can actually increase the size of the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with memory. There are important mental health benefits to be gained as well. Studies suggest that for some people with depression, exercise may improve mood and symptoms just as well as medication can. In addition, a five-minute bout of exercise has been demonstrated to reduce a person\u2019s state of anxiety.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re trying to slim down, exercise is an important part of a healthy way to lose pounds. Moderate physical activity can help you burn more calories. And the good news is you don\u2019t need to train for a marathon to get in shape. But perhaps more importantly, regular exercise does so much more than that \u2014 no matter the size of your waistline. It would take almost 10 medications to replicate all the benefits encapsulated in the \u201cexercise pill.\u201d That should be good motivation to help you get moving.</p>\n<div class=\"crp_related \"><h3>Related Post:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-exercise-do-you-really-need-less-than-you-think-201512088770\"     class=\"crp_title\">Exercise: You may need less than you think</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/regular-exercise-changes-brain-improve-memory-thinking-skills-201404097110\"     class=\"crp_title\">Regular exercise changes the brain to improve memory,&hellip;</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/combine-brief-bouts-of-moderate-exercise-for-health-201309116670\"     class=\"crp_title\">Combine brief bouts of moderate exercise for health</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/standing-up-for-better-heart-health-201508058167\"     class=\"crp_title\">Standing up for better heart health</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/joggers-less-may-201502057687\"     class=\"crp_title\">For joggers, less may be more</a></li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/exercise-much-burn-calories-201605129581\">Exercise: It does so much more than burn calories</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog\">Harvard Health Blog</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/exercise-much-burn-calories-201605129581/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>2</slash:comments>\n\t\t\t<media:content url=\"http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Exercise-ceiling-blog.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" medium=\"image\" width=\"1698\" height=\"1131\">\n\t\t\t<media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Young people training in the gym]]></media:description>\n\t\t\t<media:copyright>Elizabeth Pegg Frates, MD</media:copyright>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_id>9581</hhp:post_id>\n\t\t<hhp:facebook_share_url>https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.harvard.edu%2Fblog%2Fexercise-much-burn-calories-201605129581</hhp:facebook_share_url>\n\t\t<hhp:facebook_like_button><![CDATA[<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.harvard.edu%2Fblog%2Fexercise-much-burn-calories-201605129581&amp;layout=standard&amp;show_faces=false&amp;width=450&amp;action=recommend&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;height=35\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:35px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>]]></hhp:facebook_like_button>\n\t\t<hhp:related_posts>\n\t\t\t<hhp:post>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:title>Exercise: You may need less than you think</hhp:title>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:url>http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-exercise-do-you-really-need-less-than-you-think-201512088770</hhp:url>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_image width=\"1698\" height=\"1131\">http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Exercise-ceiling-blog.jpg</hhp:post_image>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_excerpt><![CDATA[You've probably heard that if you want to lose weight, it's as simple as \"eat less, exercise more.\" A recent study suggests that a lot of exercise doesn\u2019t always translate into a lot of extra calories burned.

An estimated 300,000 total hip replacements are performed each year in this country, and that number is expected to nearly double by 2030. The most common reason is osteoarthritis, the age-related \u201cwear-and-tear\u201d type of arthritis that can be difficult to treat with medications or other non-surgical approaches.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve had a hip replacement yourself, you may have experienced some things that surprised you. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Despite having major surgery on the largest joint in the body, you probably stood up and started walking on it within a day or two.</li>\n<li>You probably were only in the hospital for a few days.</li>\n<li>The improvement in the arthritic pain is usually noticeable right away.</li>\n<li>Despite all that, after discharge from the hospital, the physical therapy visits seemed to go on forever.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In fact, it\u2019s routine after hip replacement surgery to have extensive physical therapy \u2014 also called rehabilitation therapy, or \u201crehab.\u201d This usually consists of a series of outpatient appointments with a physical therapist. These visits usually take place two or three times a week for a month or more to help you work on strengthening, stamina, and balance.</p>\n<h3>Is home rehab just as good?</h3>\n<p>A new study calls into question the way people receive rehab after hip replacement surgery.</p>\n<p>The researchers presented their findings at a recent meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. They described how, among 77 people having hip replacement surgery, half were randomly assigned to meet with a physical therapist 2 or 3 times a week for 2 months. The rest were instructed on particular exercises to be performed on their own at home for two months.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what they found:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One month after surgery, there were no major differences in the individuals\u2019 ability to function as assessed by their ability to sit, walk, and use stairs, or other measures of daily activities.</li>\n<li>Six months after the surgery, there was still no difference in results.</li>\n<li>Changing the routine physical therapy from supervised appointments to exercising at home could be accompanied by a significant reduction in the cost of care. And the convenience is an extra bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, this may not work for everyone. Many people who have hip replacement surgery cannot return home right away, especially if they live alone and have to climb a number of stairs right away. For them, surgery is followed by a stay at a rehabilitation facility, where they receive supervised physical therapy on a daily basis until they\u2019re strong and steady enough to get around safely at home.</p>\n<p>Another consideration in how post-op rehab is provided is the notion of \u201cpre-hab\u201d \u2014 that is, when surgery can be planned in advance (such as a hip replacement for arthritis), an exercise program prior to surgery may be useful. Those willing and able to exercise before surgery may have an easier time with home rehab.</p>\n<h3>So, now what?</h3>\n<p>This new research should be considered preliminary because it included only a small number of study subjects and the results were presented at a medical conference; they have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

It brings to mind all sorts of things we never want to have happen to our children, from overdoses to arrests \u2014 and so we talk to our kids about drugs and alcohol. But is there another addiction we should be worrying about, too?</p>\n<p>The Merriam-Webster definition of <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/addiction\">addiction</a> is \u201ca strong and harmful need to regularly have something (such as a drug) or do something (such as gamble).\u201d Using that definition, you could make a real argument that many teens are becoming addicted to their mobile devices.</p>\n<p>You could make the same argument about their parents \u2014 and plenty of other people, too.</p>\n<p>Common Sense Media recently published a <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/technology-addiction-concern-controversy-and-finding-balance\">report</a> on a survey they did on 1,240 parents and teens (620 parent-child pairs). The findings are not a big surprise to anyone who, well, looks up from their phone. They found that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>50% of teens feel that they are addicted to their mobile devices (and 28% think that their parents are too)</li>\n<li>27% of parents feel that they are addicted to their mobile devices (and 59% think that their teens are too)</li>\n<li>66% of parents feel that their teens spend too much time on their mobile devices \u2014 and 52% of the teens agree with them</li>\n<li>48% of parents and 72% of teens feel the need to respond immediately to text messages and other notifications</li>\n<li>69% of parents and 78% of teens check their devices at least hourly</li>\n<li>half of parents and a third of teens at least occasionally try to cut down the time they spend on their devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is pretty powerful. Parents and teens are in agreement that their devices have a hold on them.</p>\n<p>Now, I don\u2019t want to seem to say that constantly checking Instagram is the same as shooting heroin. Clearly, it\u2019s not. I also want to be careful to point out that clinicians are not quite ready to use the word \u201caddiction\u201d when it comes to technology. And there is also very limited research on the long-term effects of having our faces stuck to our phones. But there is real cause for concern.</p>\n<p>Devices displace. It\u2019s that simple. We only have so much bandwidth when it comes to awareness, interaction, and memory; multitasking is, ultimately, simply paying less attention to more things. And when you pay less attention, there can be consequences.</p>\n<p>For teens, there are consequences when it comes to learning (it\u2019s hard to lay down new memories and learn new material when you are distracted), social relationships (it\u2019s hard to build or maintain them, and to hone social skills, when you are on your phone), sleep (which can have tremendous impacts on both mental and physical health), safety (like using the device while driving or crossing the street) and the general and important ability to sustain attention.</p>\n<p>For parents, besides all the consequences above (which apply to adults, too), there are concerns about how devices literally get in the way of parenting. Researchers at Boston University have done some very interesting <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/03/05/peds.2013-3703.abstract\">observational studies</a> of parents and children, and found (here\u2019s a shocker) that when parents are on their phones, they <a href=\"http://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm/2014/12/09/mobile-device-use-leads-to-few-interactions-between-mother-and-child-during-mealtime/\">interact less with their children</a>. Given that so much of relationship-building and cognitive development depends on interaction, the implications \u2014 which may not be fully seen for years \u2014 could be significant, even profound.</p>\n<p>We need more research to understand all those implications. But in the meantime, the message is clear: devices need to be used thoughtfully, and with care.</p>\n<p>Every person and every family is different \u2014 and so every approach to a healthy balance is going to be different. But there are three times when device use should be as close to zero as possible:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When it impacts safety, like when driving or walking. This is where the zero comes in.</li>\n<li>When attention is important for learning or performance, like at school, doing homework, or in the workplace.</li>\n<li>During social gatherings, like meals or parties \u2014 or simply hanging out or having a conversation. It\u2019s one thing to use devices to connect with people who are somewhere else; it\u2019s entirely another to use devices when those people are sitting next to you. Our connections with other people are crucial for our health and well-being; we cannot let our devices undermine those connections.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out the Common Sense Media report. Talk about it as a family. Do some soul-searching. Make some ground rules. Make sure that every day, you spend time paying full attention to the world around you \u2014 and to the people you love.</p>\n<p>Watch the short video below. It\u2019s powerful \u2014 and brings the point home. </p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OINa46HeWg8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"crp_related \"><h3>Related Post:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/many-babies-and-toddlers-use-mobile-devices-every-day-201511128579\"     class=\"crp_title\">Many babies and toddlers use mobile devices every day</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/heads-up-parents-new-study-with-important-information-about-the-online-life-of-teens-201510168436\"     class=\"crp_title\">Heads up, parents: New study with important information&hellip;</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/beyond-the-2-hour-screen-rule-10-tips-for-parenting-in-the-digital-age-201512018667\"     class=\"crp_title\">Beyond the 2-hour screen rule: 10 tips for parenting in the&hellip;</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/10-ways-to-raise-a-healthy-eater-201603019296\"     class=\"crp_title\">10 ways to raise a healthy eater</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/teens-with-upbeat-friends-may-have-better-emotional-health-201512108797\"     class=\"crp_title\">Teens with upbeat friends may have better emotional health</a></li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/latest-dangerous-addiction-parents-need-worry-mobile-devices-201605109680\">The latest dangerous &#8220;addiction&#8221; parents need to worry about: Mobile devices</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog\">Harvard Health Blog</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/latest-dangerous-addiction-parents-need-worry-mobile-devices-201605109680/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>2</slash:comments>\n\t\t\t<media:content url=\"http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/teen-phone-addiction-blog.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" medium=\"image\" width=\"1698\" height=\"1131\">\n\t\t\t<media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Teenagers Using Mobile Phones]]></media:description>\n\t\t\t<media:copyright>Claire McCarthy, MD</media:copyright>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_id>9680</hhp:post_id>\n\t\t<hhp:facebook_share_url>https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.harvard.edu%2Fblog%2Flatest-dangerous-addiction-parents-need-worry-mobile-devices-201605109680</hhp:facebook_share_url>\n\t\t<hhp:facebook_like_button><![CDATA[<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.harvard.edu%2Fblog%2Flatest-dangerous-addiction-parents-need-worry-mobile-devices-201605109680&amp;layout=standard&amp;show_faces=false&amp;width=450&amp;action=recommend&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;height=35\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:35px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>]]></hhp:facebook_like_button>\n\t\t<hhp:related_posts>\n\t\t\t<hhp:post>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:title>Many babies and toddlers use mobile devices every day</hhp:title>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:url>http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/many-babies-and-toddlers-use-mobile-devices-every-day-201511128579</hhp:url>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_image width=\"1698\" height=\"1131\">http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/teen-phone-addiction-blog.jpg</hhp:post_image>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_excerpt><![CDATA[If you've looked up from your phone recently \u2014 or even if you haven't! \u2014 you may have noticed that many children and teens are glued to their devices.

After all, your heart and brain are located in different regions of your body, and cardiology and neurology are separate disciplines. Yet these organs are <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3547419/\">intimately connected</a>, and when your emotions adversely affect your brain, your heart is affected as well.</p>\n<h3>The negative impact of emotions when your heart is already vulnerable</h3>\n<p>There are <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26227991\">two kinds of stress</a> that impact your brain. Helpful stress (also known as eustress) <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1876756/\">can assist</a> you with getting things done by helping you focus your attention. Unhelpful stress (distress), on the other hand, can be so severe that it can lead to fatigue and heart disease.</p>\n<p>If you have coronary artery disease (CAD), your heart may be deprived of oxygen. This deprivation, called myocardial ischemia, can occur in as many as <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3726062/\">30% to 50%</a> of all patients with CAD. It can be further exacerbated by emotional stress. In fact, if you have any type of heart disease, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3196868/\">any strong emotion such as anger</a> may also cause severe and fatal irregular heart rhythms. Expressions like \u201cdied from fright\u201d and \u201cworried to death\u201d are not just hyperbole \u2014 they are physiologic possibilities. Furthermore, when patients with newly diagnosed heart disease become depressed, that depression increases the risk that a harmful heart-related event will occur within that year.</p>\n<h3>The negative impact of emotions when you have no heart disease</h3>\n<p>Of course, stress can have a big effect on your heart even if you don&#8217;t have heart disease. Here&#8217;s just one example: In 1997, cardiologist Lauri Toivonen and colleagues conducted a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9283539\">study</a> of EKG changes in healthy physicians before and during the first 30 seconds of an emergency call. They saw changes that indicated oxygen deprivation and abnormal heart rhythms.</p>\n<p>More recent studies have also observed these changes in the setting of with <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4662914/\">stress, anxiety, and depression</a> \u2014 all of which are, of course, brain-based conditions. Even in people with no prior heart disease, major depression <a href=\"http://www.rug.nl/research/portal/publications/depression-and-cardiac-mortality--results-from-a-communitybased-longitudinal-study(92f622e8-c8be-429b-94e1-4e47d65cabc1)/export.html\">doubles</a> the risk of dying from heart-related causes.</p>\n<h3>Cardiac psychology: Tending to your emotions for your heart\u2019s sake</h3>\n<p>It is important to <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/managing-worry-in-generalized-anxiety-disorder-201602179172\">control your worry and stress</a>, not just because you will worry less and feel better, but because less worry means less stress for your heart. This applies to the entire range of stressors, from a small episode of acute panic to a larger context such as living through a natural disaster. For all the reasons outlined above, a new emotion-based approach to heart health, called cardiac psychology, is receiving increasing interest.</p>\n<p>You really can change your brain and get a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4523709/\">healthier heart</a><u> in the process</u>. Here are some ways to get started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><em>Seek professional help</em>.</strong> Don\u2019t ignore stress, anxiety, depression, excessive worry, or bouts of anger that overwhelm your life. Seek professional help. If you meet criteria for a diagnosis, treatment can help reduce symptoms, thereby protecting your brain <em>and</em> your heart.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Available treatments in cardiac psychology</em>.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4523709/\">Aside from more traditional psychiatric treatment</a> and exercise, psycho-educational programs, educational training, stress management, biofeedback, counseling sessions, and relaxation techniques should all be considered before or after a <em>heart</em>-related event. Newer treatments such as <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01284/full\">acceptance and commitment therapy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21453841\">expressive writing</a> can also be helpful.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Exercise</em>.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4349343/\">Physical exercise</a> can help you have a healthier heart and brain \u2014 in the right doses. For example, many recent studies have demonstrated that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12661673\">aerobic exercise</a> can help you be more mentally nimble by helping you think faster and more flexibly. Even <a href=\"http://psychsocgerontology.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/08/08/geronb.gbs069.full.pdf\">frail older adults</a> have improved their thinking and overall psychological well-being from exercising for one hour, three times a week. And people in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23590224\">rehabilitation after being diagnosed with heart failure</a> report clearer thinking when their fitness levels improve.As clinical research scientist Michelle Ploughman commented, &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18781504\">exercise is brain food</a>.&#8221; Various types of aerobic exercise, including jogging, swimming, cycling, walking, gardening, and dancing, have all been proven to <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/15518309\">reduce anxiety and depression</a><u> and to </u>improve <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15255923\">self-esteem</a>. This is thought to be due to an increase in blood circulation in the brain, and the fact that exercise can improve the brain&#8217;s ability to react to stress.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A starting point for better brain \u2014 and heart \u2014 health</h3>\n<p>If you struggle with stress, anger, anxiety, worry, depression, or problems with self-esteem, talk to your primary care physician \u2014 or a cardiologist, if you have one. A consultation with a psychiatrist may be very helpful. Together, you can explore which of these potential therapies might best protect your psychological state, your brain, and your heart.</p>\n<div class=\"crp_related \"><h3>Related Post:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-simply-moving-benefits-your-mental-health-201603289350\"     class=\"crp_title\">How simply moving benefits your mental health</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/psychology-low-back-pain-201604259537\"     class=\"crp_title\">The psychology of low back pain</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/regular-exercise-changes-brain-improve-memory-thinking-skills-201404097110\"     class=\"crp_title\">Regular exercise changes the brain to improve memory,&hellip;</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/getting-closer-to-understanding-how-exercise-keeps-brains-young-201509048246\"     class=\"crp_title\">Getting closer to understanding how exercise keeps brains&hellip;</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/a-stronger-heart-may-keep-your-brain-young-201602249182\"     class=\"crp_title\">A stronger heart may keep your brain young</a></li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/managing-emotions-can-save-heart-201605099541\">Managing your emotions can save your heart</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog\">Harvard Health Blog</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/managing-emotions-can-save-heart-201605099541/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>26</slash:comments>\n\t\t\t<media:content url=\"http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Srinis-mindheart-blog.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" medium=\"image\" width=\"5000\" height=\"3333\">\n\t\t\t<media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[brain and heart]]></media:description>\n\t\t\t<media:copyright>Srini Pillay, MD</media:copyright>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_id>9541</hhp:post_id>\n\t\t<hhp:facebook_share_url>https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.harvard.edu%2Fblog%2Fmanaging-emotions-can-save-heart-201605099541</hhp:facebook_share_url>\n\t\t<hhp:facebook_like_button><![CDATA[<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.harvard.edu%2Fblog%2Fmanaging-emotions-can-save-heart-201605099541&amp;layout=standard&amp;show_faces=false&amp;width=450&amp;action=recommend&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;height=35\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:35px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>]]></hhp:facebook_like_button>\n\t\t<hhp:related_posts>\n\t\t\t<hhp:post>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:title>How simply moving benefits your mental health</hhp:title>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:url>http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-simply-moving-benefits-your-mental-health-201603289350</hhp:url>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_image width=\"5000\" height=\"3333\">http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Srinis-mindheart-blog.jpg</hhp:post_image>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_excerpt><![CDATA[Phrases like \"I almost died of fright\" aren't just hyperbole.

We've listed some ways you can get started.]]></hhp:post_excerpt>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_date>2016-05-09 09:30:55</hhp:post_date>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_date_gmt>2016-05-09 13:30:55</hhp:post_date_gmt>\n\t\t\t</hhp:post>\n\t\t</hhp:related_posts>\n\t\t<hhp:post_image width=\"5000\" height=\"3333\" >http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Srinis-mindheart-blog.jpg</hhp:post_image>\n\t\t<hhp:author_image><img src=\"http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/srini-velvet-jacket-headshot-150x150.jpg\" width=\"96\" height=\"96\" alt=\"Srini Pillay, MD\" class=\"avatar avatar-96 wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-96 alignnone photo\" /></hhp:author_image>\n\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>More than sad: Depression affects your ability to think</title>\n\t\t<link>http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sad-depression-affects-ability-think-201605069551</link>\n\t\t<comments>http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sad-depression-affects-ability-think-201605069551#comments</comments>\n\t\t<pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2016 13:30:36 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[James Cartreine, PhD]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Anxiety and Depression]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Behavioral Health]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Brain and cognitive health]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Health]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Mental Health]]></category>\n\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/?p=9551</guid>\n\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>We often think of depression as making someone feel \"down,\" but it can sometimes show up as cognitive symptoms \u2014 for example, trouble with adapting to new information or thinking through a solution to a problem.

But besides these, depression can actually change your ability to think. It can impair your attention and memory, as well as your information processing and decision-making skills. It can also lower your cognitive flexibility (the ability to adapt your goals and strategies to changing situations) and executive functioning (the ability to take all the steps to get something done).</p>\n<p>For people with severe depression, medications can provide some relief of low mood and energy, bolster the motivation to engage in enjoyable and important activities, and help people return to normal sleeping and eating patterns. (Notably, antidepressants are less helpful in general for mild and moderate depression.)</p>\n<p>But we don\u2019t know whether antidepressant medications treat cognitive impairment related to depression. Recently, an international research team attempted to answer this question as part of a larger study on depression treatment. <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(16)00012-2/abstract\">Their results</a> were published in <em>The Lancet </em>last month.</p>\n<p>To study the effect of three common antidepressant medications on depression-related cognitive impairment, the researchers asked over 1,000 people with depression who were taking either escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft), or venlafaxine-XR (Effexor-XR) to go through extensive cognitive testing. In short, none of the medications helped. Of these patients, 95% showed no improvement on any of the cognitive impairments mentioned above, and none of the three drugs was better than the others at improving cognitive symptoms.</p>\n<p>This result is not completely surprising \u2014 antidepressant medications are mainly meant to help improve mood and increase the ability to participate in beneficial and enjoyable activities, two key aspects of depression treatment. It&#8217;s also worth noting that different parts and processes of the brain are responsible for cognitive (versus emotional) functioning; this may explain why the three drugs tested didn&#8217;t seem to help improve cognitive symptoms. New drugs for depression may be able to address these symptoms as well.</p>\n<p>Beyond medications, problem-solving treatment can train people how to improve their problem-solving skills, and cognitive behavioral therapy can teach people to recognize and challenge distorted thinking patterns. Another approach, cognitive remediation therapy, uses practice drills to improve memory and executive functioning. Combining these behavioral interventions with antidepressants may yield better results for improving depression-related cognitive impairments.</p>\n<p>There are some limitations to this study: it\u2019s not known if the participants had cognitive impairments before they developed depression, and the length of drug treatment and follow-up was short \u2014 eight weeks in total. However, this study is important because the cognitive impairment symptoms of depression have received little attention \u2014 and haven\u2019t necessarily been the target of medications for depression. It shows that we have a long way to go in helping people with depression return to a normal level of full mental functioning.</p>\n<div class=\"crp_related \"><h3>Related Post:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/comptuer-guided-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-can-it-improve-depression-treatment-in-primary-care-201512178856\"     class=\"crp_title\">Can computer-guided cognitive behavioral therapy improve&hellip;</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/bypass-surgery-an-uncommon-cause-of-memory-loss-cognitive-decline-201507228148\"     class=\"crp_title\">Bypass surgery an &#8220;uncommon&#8221; cause of memory&hellip;</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/new-depression-screening-guidelines-benefit-pregnant-women-and-new-moms-201603029222\"     class=\"crp_title\">New depression screening guidelines benefit pregnant women&hellip;</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/can-depression-worsen-ra-symptoms-or-make-treatment-less-effective-201510148427\"     class=\"crp_title\">Can depression worsen RA symptoms or make treatment less&hellip;</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/antidepressants-cause-minimal-weight-gain-201406067202\"     class=\"crp_title\">Antidepressants cause minimal weight gain</a></li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sad-depression-affects-ability-think-201605069551\">More than sad: Depression affects your ability to think</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog\">Harvard Health Blog</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sad-depression-affects-ability-think-201605069551/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>6</slash:comments>\n\t\t\t<media:content url=\"http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/HiRes.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" medium=\"image\" width=\"5625\" height=\"3750\">\n\t\t\t<media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[HiRes]]></media:description>\n\t\t\t<media:copyright>James Cartreine, PhD</media:copyright>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_id>9551</hhp:post_id>\n\t\t<hhp:facebook_share_url>https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.harvard.edu%2Fblog%2Fsad-depression-affects-ability-think-201605069551</hhp:facebook_share_url>\n\t\t<hhp:facebook_like_button><![CDATA[<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.harvard.edu%2Fblog%2Fsad-depression-affects-ability-think-201605069551&amp;layout=standard&amp;show_faces=false&amp;width=450&amp;action=recommend&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;height=35\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:35px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>]]></hhp:facebook_like_button>\n\t\t<hhp:related_posts>\n\t\t\t<hhp:post>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:title>Can computer&#45;guided cognitive behavioral therapy improve depression treatment?</hhp:title>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:url>http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/comptuer-guided-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-can-it-improve-depression-treatment-in-primary-care-201512178856</hhp:url>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_image width=\"5625\" height=\"3750\">http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/HiRes.jpg</hhp:post_image>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_excerpt><![CDATA[We often think of depression as making someone feel \"down,\" but it can sometimes show up as cognitive symptoms \u2014 for example, trouble with adapting to new information or thinking through a solution to a problem.

As my career has progressed, I\u2019ve seen many new drugs released to the market. Some of them are truly miraculous, bringing people longer, healthier, and more productive lives. Many of them have not withstood the test of time. More than a few have even been taken off the market. Even though the Food and Drug Administration diligently reviews each new medicine before it\u2019s approved for use, we often learn much more about a drug after its release into the general population.</p>\n<p>I reflected on that memory when I read <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1600962\">a recent editorial</a> in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em> (NEJM) about insulin resistance. In his editorial, the author tells us of the \u201clong, strange trip\u201d of a class of medications called thiazolidinediones, which help people who have type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes to be more sensitive to the insulin that they make in their bodies. (Many diabetes medications work by helping the body lower its resistance to insulin in different ways.)</p>\n<p>When they were first released, these medicines were widely accepted and adopted. We do, after all, have an epidemic of obesity and diabetes in the United States, and they seemed to work very well for people. They seemed a great alternative to insulin, which has to be injected. Then, after about 6 years on the market, these drugs began to be linked to liver disease and congestive heart failure \u2014 and maybe even cancer. Even though longer-term studies did not show that there was a definite risk of heart attack or cancer, these drugs became unpopular and fell into disuse. We were not willing to take a chance with our patients when we had other good options.</p>\n<p>And yet, some researchers continued to wonder if there was any safe role for these very potent medications with their many positive effects, despite the concerns. The same NEJM issue as the editorial referenced above also contains a study that showed that certain carefully selected patients might, in fact, have fewer strokes if they took a medication called pioglitazone, which is in the thiazolidinedione class of medicines. Interestingly, the patients in this trial were already on extremely comprehensive stroke prevention regimens \u2014 and <em>still</em> they decreased their risk of a future stroke by 24%. These patients, all of whom were at risk of developing diabetes, had a slower rate of progression to diabetes as well.</p>\n<p>What grabbed me about this story? First, it would seem that the drugs in question are neither panacea nor pariah. Pioglitazone, in fact, might a very good drug to prevent stroke <em>in a</em> <em>very select population</em>.</p>\n<p>But, can we define that select population? That might be the most interesting tale of the past decades. Twenty years ago, we could only guess, based on certain characteristics of a patient, whether a medication would be effective. Today, we know certain people\u2019s genetics make them better candidates for certain medications than other people. We are close to being able to tailor a medication to the patient at the level of his or her genes. When we are able to do this in an effective, safe, and efficient way, we will be able to deliver truly personalized medicine. As a clinician, I find this truly exciting.

Study after study indicates instead that back pain is very often caused by our thoughts, feelings, and resulting behaviors. And an exciting new study now demonstrates that treatments aimed at our beliefs and attitudes can really help.</p>\n<p>When our back hurts, it\u2019s only natural to assume that we\u2019ve suffered an injury or have a disease. After all, most pain works this way. When we cut our finger, we see blood and feel pain. When our throat hurts, it\u2019s usually because of an infection.</p>\n<p>But back pain is different. There simply isn\u2019t a close connection between the condition of the spine and whether or not people experience pain. Research has shown that a majority of people who have never had any significant back pain have the very same \u201cabnormalities\u201d (such as bulging or herniated spinal discs) that are frequently blamed for chronic back conditions. And then there are the millions of people with severe chronic back pain who show no structural abnormalities in their back at all.</p>\n<p>On top of this, it turns out that people in developing countries, who do back-breaking labor and don\u2019t have easy access to medical treatment, have much fewer incidents of chronic back pain than people in the developed world who sit in ergonomically designed chairs, sleep on fancy mattresses, and have ready access to spinal imaging, surgery, and medications.</p>\n<p>Because there\u2019s so little correlation between the condition of the spine and any given person&#8217;s experience with back pain, clinicians and researchers have begun looking instead at treatments that address the psychological and behavioral patterns that can lock people into years of suffering. And they\u2019ve just demonstrated that two of these treatments work much better than traditional medical interventions alone.</p>\n<h3>What actually helps back pain</h3>\n<p>Last week, researchers at the University of Washington published a <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2504811\">landmark study</a> in <em>The</em> <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> that showed training people with chronic low back pain in either mindfulness or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) works significantly better than medical care alone to reduce both their disability and pain-related suffering. The researchers randomly assigned 320 adults, ages 20 to 70, to either an eight-week class in one of these methods, or to &#8220;usual care.&#8221; The subjects who attended the classes saw significantly more improvement in their pain and disability than those receiving usual care \u2014 and this greater improvement was still evident a full year later, when the study ended.</p>\n<p>Mindfulness training teaches us to be aware of, and accept, moment-to-moment physical sensations of discomfort, while letting go of our usual negative reactions. So instead of spending hours each day thinking about how much we hate our back pain, worrying about our prognosis, and seeking relief, we learn how to <em>be with</em> the pain \u2014 paying attention to how it actually feels at each moment and relaxing our tendency to tense up against it, while observing our worried or distressed thoughts and feelings coming and going.</p>\n<p>CBT takes a somewhat different approach. It helps us learn to observe and identify our negative thoughts about our condition, and replace them with more realistic ones.</p>\n<p>Both methods help us see the functioning of our minds more clearly, and the role that anxious, angry, and frustrated thoughts and feelings about our condition play in increasing our fear and stress.</p>\n<p>And as it turns out, it is precisely this fear and stress that maintains most chronic back pain. This explains why events such as childhood physical and sexual abuse, painful losses, and job dissatisfaction have all been shown to be risk factors for the condition.</p>\n<h3>Take action for back pain relief</h3>\n<p>The excellent news is that for most of us, chronic back pain needn\u2019t derail our lives. CBT is available at many pain clinics, as is mindfulness training.</p>\n<p>You might also try on your own. You could explore CBT using the book on which the University of Washington class was based: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pain-Survival-Guide-Reclaim-Lifetools/dp/1591470498/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459285344&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=pain+survival+guide+by+dennis+turk\"><em>The Pain Survival Guide: How to Reclaim Your Life</em></a><em>.</em> Alternatively, you can try mindfulness practice by following recorded instructions. While there are many resources for these, you can listen for free to some that I recorded at <a href=\"http://mindfulness-solution.com/\">mindfulness-solution.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, for a comprehensive guide to using mindfulness along with rehabilitation to work through chronic back pain, you can consult a book I co-authored on the subject: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Back-Sense-Revolutionary-Approach-Halting/dp/0767905814/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1459285259&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=back+sense\"><em>Back Sense: A Revolutionary Guide to Halting the Cycle of Chronic Back Pain</em></a>.</p>\n<div class=\"crp_related \"><h3>Related Post:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/psychology-low-back-pain-201604259537\"     class=\"crp_title\">The psychology of low back pain</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/bad-weather-isnt-blame-aching-back-201407117262\"     class=\"crp_title\">Bad weather isn&#8217;t to blame for your aching back</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/early-scans-for-back-pain-add-cost-but-offer-little-benefit-for-seniors-201503207821\"     class=\"crp_title\">Early scans for back pain add cost but offer little benefit&hellip;</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/complementary-therapies-for-neck-pain-201511038559\"     class=\"crp_title\">Complementary therapies for neck pain</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-right-goal-when-managing-pain-201512188865\"     class=\"crp_title\">The \u201cright\u201d goal when managing pain</a></li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/mind-back-pain-201605049517\">Mind over back pain</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog\">Harvard Health Blog</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/mind-back-pain-201605049517/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>11</slash:comments>\n\t\t\t<media:content url=\"http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/back-pain-lower-black-man.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" medium=\"image\" width=\"1699\" height=\"1130\">\n\t\t\t<media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Backache.

There was a platform that was high off the ground, with various ladders to climb up as well as two slides (one straight and one curvy) and a pole to slide down or climb up. There were even some monkey bars leading up to it on one side. It could be a castle or a pirate ship or a space ship, and climbing it or mastering the monkey bars was a big, pride-filled milestone. It was awesome.</p>\n<p>When they renovated the park, they took it down. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing good there anymore,\u201d said my youngest. \u201cIt\u2019s all little kid stuff.\u201d Everything in the playground now is close to the ground \u2014 and hard to get hurt on.</p>\n<p>It made me sad.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 as a parent and pediatrician, I want children to be safe on the playground. Between 1996 and 2005, US emergency rooms treated about 200,000 children a year for playground injuries, which is a lot. I worry especially about traumatic brain injuries (TBI) such as concussions, as they can have long-term consequences; a <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/04/28/peds.2015-2721?sso=1&amp;sso_redirect_count=1&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token\" target=\"_blank\">study just released</a> in the journal <em>Pediatrics</em> showed that between 2001 and 2013, there were 21,000 emergency room visits a year for TBI\u2019s in children 14 years old and younger.</p>\n<p>The study showed that the number of playground TBIs seen in emergency rooms rose between 2005 and 2013 \u2014 but it\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s because there were truly more of them or whether both parents and doctors were becoming more aware of and concerned about concussions. The fact that more than 95% of the children were treated and released, meaning that the injuries were minor, supports this explanation. Until relatively recently, most parents wouldn\u2019t have brought their child to the emergency room for a head bump unless the child lost consciousness, needed stitches or otherwise seemed very unwell; head bumps were considered a normal part of childhood.</p>\n<p>We now understand that head bumps can be more dangerous than we realized, and we are more careful at playgrounds (and in sports). That\u2019s why the yellow climbing structure came down, I\u2019m sure; the study found that playing on those, and swings, was the biggest cause of TBI. But as a parent and pediatrician, I think we need to be careful with being careful.</p>\n<p>Concussions shouldn\u2019t be a normal part of childhood, and playgrounds should be safe. But being safe isn\u2019t just an environment thing; it\u2019s also a learned skill. Children need to learn what and where the dangers are, and how to avoid them. They need to learn their limitations \u2014 and learn when to respect them, and when to push them.</p>\n<p>These aren\u2019t just safety lessons, they are life lessons. Life is full of challenge and risk. And whether it\u2019s a broken arm or a broken heart, sometimes we get hurt as we learn to meet those challenges and risks.</p>\n<p>So of course, let\u2019s make our playgrounds safe. Let\u2019s make sure there are soft surfaces beneath climbing structures and swings. Let\u2019s make sure that equipment is maintained properly. Let\u2019s make sure that caregivers supervise children. Let\u2019s educate people on the signs of concussion, and on what to do if they see those signs.</p>\n<p>But let\u2019s not get overprotective in the process. Let\u2019s not take down all the high climbing structures or big swings \u2014 and especially, let\u2019s not stop our children from doing anything that might be risky. Because the risks will always be there \u2014 and we won\u2019t always be there to watch them. It\u2019s better they practice now, on a playground, with us nearby.</p>\n<div class=\"crp_related \"><h3>Related Post:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/which-kids-are-most-likely-to-have-prolonged-concussion-symptoms-201604149437\"     class=\"crp_title\">Which kids are most likely to have prolonged concussion&hellip;</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/falling-tvs-injure-17000-kids-a-year-201307226503\"     class=\"crp_title\">Falling TVs injure 17,000 kids a year</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/overweight-children-are-at-risk-for-heart-disease-as-adults-201509308367\"     class=\"crp_title\">Overweight children are at risk for heart disease as adults</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/editorial-calls-for-more-research-on-link-between-football-and-brain-damage-201503257828\"     class=\"crp_title\">Editorial calls for more research on link between football&hellip;</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/many-babies-and-toddlers-use-mobile-devices-every-day-201511128579\"     class=\"crp_title\">Many babies and toddlers use mobile devices every day</a></li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/preventing-playground-injuries-fine-line-safe-overprotective-201605039634\">Preventing playground injuries: The fine line between safe and overprotective</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog\">Harvard Health Blog</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/preventing-playground-injuries-fine-line-safe-overprotective-201605039634/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>1</slash:comments>\n\t\t\t<media:content url=\"http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Playground-blog-image.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" medium=\"image\" width=\"1698\" height=\"1131\">\n\t\t\t<media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Many kids stand on red ropes together in park]]></media:description>\n\t\t\t<media:copyright>Claire McCarthy, MD</media:copyright>\n\t\t</media:content>\n\t\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_id>9634</hhp:post_id>\n\t\t<hhp:facebook_share_url>https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.harvard.edu%2Fblog%2Fpreventing-playground-injuries-fine-line-safe-overprotective-201605039634</hhp:facebook_share_url>\n\t\t<hhp:facebook_like_button><![CDATA[<iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.health.harvard.edu%2Fblog%2Fpreventing-playground-injuries-fine-line-safe-overprotective-201605039634&amp;layout=standard&amp;show_faces=false&amp;width=450&amp;action=recommend&amp;font=arial&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;height=35\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:35px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>]]></hhp:facebook_like_button>\n\t\t<hhp:related_posts>\n\t\t\t<hhp:post>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:title>Which kids are most likely to have prolonged concussion symptoms?</hhp:title>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:url>http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/which-kids-are-most-likely-to-have-prolonged-concussion-symptoms-201604149437</hhp:url>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_image width=\"1698\" height=\"1131\">http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Playground-blog-image.jpg</hhp:post_image>\n\t\t\t\t<hhp:post_excerpt><![CDATA[You may have noticed that many playgrounds are now \"safer\" than they used to be.

So why do I have high blood pressure?\u201d Despite its astonishing prevalence of one in three Americans, many people struggle with the diagnosis of high blood pressure, or hypertension. It\u2019s worth exploring why, because being an active participant in your care is crucial for optimal blood pressure control.</p>\n<p>Certain features make any diagnosis easier to accept:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, people are more likely to accept a diagnosis if they have <strong>symptoms</strong>. A person with cough and fever will believe a diagnosis of pneumonia. But someone who feels fine would not.</li>\n<li>Next, people more readily accept a diagnosis if it is not<strong> serious</strong>. Most people won\u2019t question the diagnosis of athlete\u2019s foot, because creams can cure it. Diagnoses that carry worse prognoses are usually harder to receive.</li>\n<li>Finally, people accept a diagnosis better when they understand its <strong>cause</strong>. Some diseases have clear causes: Down syndrome and older maternal age, HIV infection and contaminated needles. A smoker who learns he has lung cancer may not be shocked. But non-smokers who receive this diagnosis usually ask, \u201cWhy me?\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>People diagnosed with hypertension are often baffled, and many ask, &#8220;Why me?&#8221; This doubt makes sense, in light of the principles above. <strong>Symptoms</strong> make a diagnosis more real. But unlike many other illnesses, hypertension rarely causes symptoms. In fact, it is ominously called the &#8220;silent killer.&#8221; Some people develop headaches when their blood pressure rises into dangerous territory, but in others, hypertension can go undetected until it causes a lethal heart attack. Fortunately, it is easy and painless to measure blood pressure.</p>\n<p>When doctors deliver the diagnosis of hypertension, they package it with <strong>serious</strong> complications. These include heart attack, kidney failure, and stroke. Doctors discuss risks to motivate their patients, but sometimes end up creating fear instead. And fear can lead to denial. Is hypertension serious? Yes, if left untreated. But when blood pressure is controlled, the risks are greatly reduced. The important message is that treating hypertension can prevent severe complications and add dramatically to life expectancy.</p>\n<p>Last, knowing the <strong>cause</strong> of disease is helpful. In reality we rarely find just one cause for anyone\u2019s hypertension. There are almost always multiple factors at work. Some causes can\u2019t be prevented, like genetics and age. High blood pressure often runs in families. Genetic risk is complex, probably resulting from a combination of harmful mutations in risk genes and silencing of protective genes. There is nothing we can do to change our genetics, just as we can\u2019t stop aging. With aging comes a universal increase in systolic blood pressure (the top number) and in the risk for heart disease. On the other hand, tackling modifiable risk factors for high blood pressure, for example, losing weight and getting more exercise, often produces great benefits.</p>\n<h3>Your odds of developing high blood pressure are pretty good</h3>\n<p>To answer the question \u201cWhy me?\u201d it helps to know the data. The Framingham Heart Study followed a subset of 1,300 participants ages 55 to 65 who did not have hypertension at baseline. Their remarkable finding: the lifetime risk of developing hypertension was 90%. So even if you haven\u2019t developed high blood pressure by middle age, chances are nine out of ten that you will at some point. This number is most likely so high because more of us are overweight and are living longer.</p>\n<p>So instead of being surprised if you are diagnosed with hypertension, it is actually more logical to be amazed if you never develop it. On an optimistic note, we have seen a decline in the frequency of severe hypertension. We owe this fall to better treatment. So if you learn you have high blood pressure, the most important response is to accept the diagnosis. Hypertension can\u2019t remedy itself; your commitment is the first step toward great blood pressure control.</p>\n<p>Watch this video for more commentary on getting a high blood pressure diagnosis:<br />\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5o5kInwgXk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"crp_related \"><h3>Related Post:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/prehypertension-increases-stroke-risk-201403147075\"     class=\"crp_title\">Prehypertension increases stroke risk</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/update-on-the-sprint-trial-preliminary-results-pan-out-201511098597\"     class=\"crp_title\">Update on the SPRINT trial: Preliminary results pan out</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/new-guidelines-published-for-managing-high-blood-pressure-201312186953\"     class=\"crp_title\">New guidelines published for managing high blood pressure</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/high-blood-pressure-midlife-linked-later-declines-memory-thinking-skills-201408077320\"     class=\"crp_title\">High blood pressure in midlife linked to later decline in&hellip;</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/checking-blood-pressure-at-home-pays-off-201307036436\"     class=\"crp_title\">Checking blood pressure at home pays off</a></li></ul><div class=\"crp_clear\"></div></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/high-blood-pressure-why-me-201605029288\">High blood pressure: Why me?</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog\">Harvard Health Blog</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/high-blood-pressure-why-me-201605029288/feed</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t<slash:comments>28</slash:comments>\n\t\t\t<media:content url=\"http://hhpblog.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/blood-pressure-high-risk-hypertension.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" medium=\"image\" width=\"1619\" height=\"1186\">\n\t\t\t<media:description type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[blood pressure conceptual meter]]></media:description>\n\t\t\t<media:copyright>Naomi D.

They feel vindicated now that the brew they\u2019ve long touted as superior \u2014 European pressed coffee \u2014 has finally gained mainstream acceptance. No longer the domain of trendy coffee houses and upscale restaurants, pressed coffee is now fashionable in the United States and can be found in many places where coffee is sold. And the device to make this kind of coffee \u2014 known as a French press \u2014 has begun popping up on all kinds of store shelves, from tony boutiques to big-box chains. But this hot trend has a cold hard fact you should know about.</p>\n<h3>What\u2019s the brouhaha?</h3>\n<p>You make pressed coffee by mixing boiled water (hot or cold) and coarsely ground coffee beans in a special glass pitcher, then letting\u00a0the mixture steep\u00a0for a few minutes.\u00a0There\u2019s no filter to keep coffee grounds from getting into your cup; instead, you press an attached mesh plunger from the top of the pitcher to the bottom to strain the liquid and trap the coffee grounds. And it\u2019s this lack of a filter that makes pressed coffee different and potentially risky if you drink too much of it.</p>\n<p>Without a filter, some of the oily substances found in coffee beans, called diterpenes, wind up in your cup. Coffee aficionados say these oils make the brew taste better. But you should know that diterpenes have been shown to have a negative impact on health. \u201cFive to eight cups a day of unfiltered coffee may actually raise your \u2018bad\u2019 LDL cholesterol,\u201d says Dr. Eric Rimm, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.</p>\n<h3>The dark(er) side of that cup of joe</h3>\n<p>Even coffee that\u2019s poured through a filter in an automatic drip coffee maker comes with some degree of risk. Coffee contains caffeine, and in some people, too much caffeine \u2014 more than 300 milligrams per day \u2014 may lead to insomnia, nervousness, heart palpitations, and the jitters. Caffeine consumed after noontime is especially likely to interfere with sleep. \u201cIf you\u2019re drinking coffee and getting less sleep every night, you may be putting yourself at risk for developing other chronic conditions over the long term,\u201d says Dr. Rimm. Too much caffeine may also raise blood pressure. The negative effects of caffeine go away when you stop consuming it.</p>\n<h3>The good news about coffee</h3>\n<p>Coffee is also full of compounds that are good for health, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>magnesium, potassium, and niacin</li>\n<li>caffeine, which in small amounts can reduce fatigue and improve alertness and concentration</li>\n<li>potent compounds such as chlorogenic acid and polyphenols, which have antioxidant properties that help prevent cell damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dr. Rimm and his colleagues believe the combination of those ingredients may delay the absorption of blood sugar, help cells draw sugar from the blood, increase metabolic rate, and help blood vessels contract and relax. Those actions, they suspect, account for coffee\u2019s association with lower blood pressure, a slower rate of weight gain with age, and reduced risks for developing type 2 diabetes or dying from cardiovascular disease or neurological diseases.</p>\n<p>\u201cWhere we clearly see the greatest benefit is in the realm of diabetes and obesity,\u201d says Dr. Rimm. He says the health benefits of filtered coffee are associated with an intake of one to five cups per day, and for many health conditions, it doesn\u2019t matter much if the coffee has caffeine or not.</p>\n<h3>To press or not to press</h3>\n<p>If you choose to drink unfiltered, pressed coffee, Dr. Rimm recommends that you keep an eye on your cholesterol levels, to make sure your LDL levels don\u2019t rise over time. And keep your pressed coffee habit in check: stick to no more than four cups per day. You should also limit your intake of filtered coffee to no more than five cups per day.</p>\n<p>Remember, too, that some of the biggest risks of coffee come from what you may add to it: cream, sugar, or sugary syrup. These add saturated fat and empty calories to your diet, boost your blood sugar, and promote weight gain. So be careful about what you put into your cup.</p>\n<p>And if coffee isn\u2019t already part of your daily routine, don\u2019t worry about starting a love affair with it.
